# Phase 243 — Rockhound Meta-Epoch Constellation Integrated Continuous Operation Layer (RUXL-META-CONSTELLATION-CONTINUOUS-PARALLEL)

## Deterministic, Regeneration-Safe, Parallelized Meta-Epoch Constellation Integrated Continuous Operation Specification

---

### 1. Architecture (Parallel Phase A)

- **Unified Continuous-Operation Model:** Canon-governed, versioned model unifies continuous operation across all constellation nodes; no operational gaps.
- **Meta-Epoch↔Constellation Continuity:** Deterministic continuity rules ensure seamless propagation and state integrity between meta-epochs and constellations; all transitions versioned and auditable.
- **Constellation-Level Invariants/Long-Horizon Stability:** All invariants and long-horizon stability constraints enforced at constellation scale; no drift or unvalidated transitions.
- **Dependency Graph/Propagation:** Explicit, versioned dependency graph for all constellation-aware components; deterministic propagation logic across constellation nodes.

---

### 2. Engine / Execution Layer (Parallel Phase B)

- **Constellation Transition Engine Integration:** Constellation transition engine is integrated into the continuous runtime; all cycles are constellation-aware and canon-governed.
- **Sequencing/Triggers:** All constellation-aware cycles follow deterministic, rollback- and fallback-capable sequences; triggers are canon-governed and auditable.
- **ENG↔CANON↔INTEL Sync:** Synchronization across all engines, meta-epoch, and constellation scales; all state changes validated and versioned.
- **Safe Propagation:** Intelligence, canon, and engineering updates propagate safely and deterministically across constellation nodes; rollback on failure.

---

### 3. Stability & Safety (Parallel Phase C)

- **Drift Detection/Correction:** Automated, deterministic drift detection and correction at every constellation boundary and within nodes.
- **Invariant Enforcement:** UX, UI, data, and intelligence invariants enforced at constellation scale; no drift or unvalidated transitions.
- **Degraded-Mode:** Deterministic degraded-mode behavior for all constellation-aware cycles; all actions rollback-capable.
- **Regeneration/Rollback:** All regeneration and rollback logic is deterministic, versioned, and auditable for constellation-aware continuous operation.

---

### 4. Performance & Reliability (Parallel Phase D)

- **Latency/Throughput:** ≤30s constellation cycle latency; ≥99.9999% successful cycles; resource usage bounded by device class and constellation context.
- **Multi-Device/Offline-First/Field-Mode:** All logic operates offline-first and field-mode aware; syncs and validations occur when connectivity resumes.
- **Long-Horizon Optimization:** Scheduled, deterministic optimization cycles across constellation lifecycles; performance baselines enforced.

---

### 5. Observability & Oversight (Parallel Phase E)

- **Telemetry Schema:** Real-time, versioned telemetry for all constellation continuous operations; all events and anomalies logged.
- **Dashboards/Alerts:** Founder-grade dashboards; canon-governed alerts and anomaly detection at constellation scale.
- **Oversight Rhythm:** Founder oversight integrated into all constellation-aware cycles; all actions auditable and reviewable.

---

### 6. Multi-Subsystem Build Cycle (Parallel Phase F)

- **Simultaneous Generation:** Architecture, engine, continuous operation, schema, propagation, and oversight are generated and validated in parallel micro-phases.
- **Cross-Phase Invariants:** All invariants and regeneration safety rules enforced across all parallel phases; no drift or unvalidated transitions.
- **Unified Canonical Schema:** Canonical JSON schema unifies all constellation continuous-operation subsystems, ensuring deterministic, regeneration-safe operation.

---

### 7. Output Requirements

- Ultra-dense, deterministic, single-pass, parallel micro-phase execution, regeneration-safe
- Canonical JSON + human-readable spec
- No filler, no drift
