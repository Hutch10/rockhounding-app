# Lapidary Founder Operating Cycle — Years 1–3 Strategic Operating Plan (L‑FOC‑Y1‑3)

## Purpose

Deterministically define and activate the founder operating cycle for a three-year horizon, ensuring continuous governance, evolution, ecosystem, category-leadership, and founder presence postures, with explicit multi-year strategic arcs, evolution triggers, and oversight structures.

## Annual Structure (Years 1–3)

- **Annual Governance Posture:** Founder sets and publishes governance principles, escalation protocols, and integrity standards for each year; adapts posture based on prior-year synthesis.
- **Annual Evolution Posture:** Founder defines evolution priorities, blueprint update cadence, and self-improvement targets for each year; triggers long-horizon evolution events as needed.
- **Annual Ecosystem Posture:** Founder establishes ecosystem engagement, partnership, and category expansion goals; sets ecosystem maturity milestones for each year.
- **Annual Category-Leadership Posture:** Founder articulates category vision, language propagation, and stewardship commitments; adapts based on ecosystem maturity.
- **Annual Founder Presence Posture:** Founder commits to public narrative, presence rituals, and cadence templates for each year; adapts presence to strategic arcs.
- **Annual Founder Synthesis:** Founder leads comprehensive synthesis, recalibrates operating baseline, and sets strategic direction for each year.

## Multi-Year Strategic Arcs

- **Strategic Arc Definition:** Founder defines 3-year strategic arcs for governance, evolution, ecosystem, and category leadership.
- **Long-Horizon Evolution Triggers:** Predefine triggers for major blueprint, governance, or ecosystem shifts; founder initiates on signal.
- **Ecosystem Maturity Milestones:** Set and track milestones for ecosystem growth, category expansion, and stewardship impact across all three years.

## Quarterly Cycle

- **Quarterly Founder Synthesis:** Founder reviews and recalibrates all postures, targets, and lock-in rules; publishes quarterly synthesis and direction.
- **Quarterly Governance/Evolution Review:** Audit and harden governance and evolution blueprints; resolve escalations; update canon index.
- **Quarterly Ecosystem/Category Review:** Evaluate ecosystem growth, category language propagation, and stewardship impact.
- **Quarterly Founder Presence Review:** Audit public narrative, cadence adherence, and presence rituals.

## Monthly Cadence

- **Monthly Founder Cadence:** Founder reviews and signs off on all governance, evolution, ecosystem, and category-leadership checkpoints.
- **Monthly Synthesis:** Founder synthesizes progress, resolves escalations, and updates public narrative.
- **Monthly Presence Ritual:** Founder executes presence ritual and cadence template; updates public channels.

## Weekly Leadership Rhythm

- **Weekly Leadership Review:** Founder reviews audit logs, drift/escalation events, and integrity signals.
- **Weekly Blueprint/Activation Sync:** Confirm all blueprints and activation plans remain aligned; escalate mismatches.
- **Weekly Ecosystem/Category Pulse:** Monitor ecosystem signals, category language, and stewardship actions.
- **Weekly Founder Presence:** Founder executes weekly presence routine and narrative update.

## Oversight Structures

- **Escalation Routing:** All escalations auto-route to founder dashboard for review and resolution.
- **Synthesis Logging:** All posture, synthesis, and cadence events are logged and versioned for multi-year traceability.
- **Public Narrative Cross-Linking:** All public narrative and cadence updates are cross-linked to canonical sources.
- **Founder Signoff:** Required for all quarterly, monthly, and weekly syntheses; annual and multi-year syntheses set strategic direction.
