# Phase 221 — Rockhound Multi-Era Continuity & Evolutionary Stability Layer (RUXL-ERA-STABILITY)

## Deterministic, Regeneration-Safe Multi-Era Continuity & Evolutionary Stability Specification

---

### 1. Multi-Era Continuity Architecture

- **Era Boundaries/Transitions:** All era boundaries are canonically defined; transitions governed by deterministic, versioned rules.
- **Continuity Constraints:** Canon-governed constraints enforce uninterrupted operation and data integrity across eras.
- **Cross-Era Propagation:** All state, intelligence, and canon updates propagate deterministically across eras and devices.
- **Regeneration Across Eras:** Regeneration logic is era-aware, rollback-capable, and versioned; no orphaned or partial states.
- **Multi-Device/Engine Guarantees:** All engines and device classes maintain deterministic continuity during and after era transitions.

---

### 2. Evolutionary Stability Framework

- **Intelligence Evolution Stability:** All intelligence evolution is bounded by canon safety rails and deterministic validation.
- **Invariant Preservation:** UX, UI, and data invariants are preserved across all era transitions; no drift or loss.
- **Engineering Continuity:** Engineering implementation is versioned and continuity-validated at every era boundary.
- **Canon Evolution Safety:** Canon evolution is governed by explicit safety rails; all changes are auditable and rollback-capable.
- **Drift Prevention:** Automated drift detection and correction at every era transition checkpoint.

---

### 3. Era Transition Engine

- **Detection/Classification:** Era changes are detected deterministically and classified by scope, impact, and risk.
- **Safe Sequencing:** All transitions follow canon-governed, rollback-capable sequences; no partial transitions.
- **Rollback/Fallback:** All transitions are rollback- and fallback-capable; no data loss or orphaned states.
- **Replay-Safe Logs:** All transition logs are immutable, replay-safe, and auditable.
- **Founder Oversight:** Founder checkpoints are integrated at all major transitions; all actions are reviewable.

---

### 4. Cross-Engine Era Synchronization

- **ENG↔CANON↔INTEL Alignment:** All engines synchronize era state and dependencies deterministically.
- **Dependency Graph:** Multi-era dependency graph maintained and validated at every transition.
- **Intelligence Consistency:** Cross-era intelligence consistency checks; no unvalidated propagation.
- **Behavior Continuity:** Multi-device, multi-engine behavior continuity enforced across all transitions.
- **Offline-First Rules:** Era transitions are offline-first; syncs and validations occur when connectivity resumes.

---

### 5. Long-Horizon Evolution Governance

- **Seasonal/Geological/Environmental Rules:** Evolution logic adapts to seasonal, geological, and environmental context; deterministic triggers.
- **Device-Class Evolution:** Device-class evolution handled via compatibility checks and deterministic adaptation.
- **Intelligence-Generation Upgrades:** All intelligence upgrades are constraint-bound, versioned, and rollback-capable.
- **Performance Baselines:** Multi-era performance baselines enforced and regression-tested at every transition.
- **Auditability/Oversight:** Founder-grade audit trails and oversight checkpoints at all major evolution events.

### 6. Output Requirements

- Ultra-dense, deterministic, single-pass, regeneration-safe
- Canonical JSON + human-readable spec
- No filler, no drift
