# Lapidary Unified Multi‑Year Operating Epoch Activation Plan (L‑UMYOEP‑A1)

## Purpose

Deterministically activate the 5-year unified epoch, transforming the L‑UMYOEP blueprint into a living, synchronized operating engine for Lapidary and Rockhound.

## 1. Epoch‑Level Activation Steps

- **Epoch Launch:** Formalize and publish the 5-year vision, strategic arcs, and milestone map.
- **Governance Board Ignition:** Constitute the epoch governance board; assign escalation, audit, and synthesis roles.
- **Canonical Blueprint Lock-In:** Version and lock all blueprints, templates, and cycles at the epoch level; publish canon index.

## 2. Governance Ignition

- **Escalation Protocol Activation:** Enable multi-layer escalation paths; route all critical events to the appropriate synthesis layer.
- **Audit Log Centralization:** Centralize all audit, decision, and delta logs; enforce versioning and board oversight.
- **Governance Synthesis Cadence:** Schedule and automate quarterly/annual governance syntheses and recalibrations.

## 3. Evolution‑Engine Activation

- **Evolution Engine Boot:** Initialize the 5-year evolution engine; set triggers for blueprint, system, and self-improvement upgrades.
- **Quarterly Evolution Sprints:** Automate scheduling and execution of evolution sprints; escalate major shifts to board.
- **Annual Evolution Synthesis:** Schedule annual recalibration of evolution priorities and engine parameters.

## 4. Ecosystem‑Federation Triggers

- **Federation Roadmap Activation:** Publish and sequence federation phases; set integration and partnership triggers.
- **Maturity Milestone Tracking:** Automate milestone tracking and synthesis for each federation phase.
- **Federation Synthesis Cadence:** Schedule quarterly/annual federation syntheses and recalibrations.

## 5. Category‑Leadership Ignition

- **Category Arc Launch:** Publish 5-year category vision and expansion milestones.
- **Expansion Triggering:** Automate tracking and escalation of category expansion events.
- **Category Synthesis Cadence:** Schedule quarterly/annual category syntheses and recalibrations.

## 6. Founder‑Presence Scaling

- **Epoch Cadence Launch:** Publish founder presence scaling plan; automate cadence and ritual scheduling.
- **Presence Delegation:** Enable presence delegation and narrative propagation as system scales.
- **Founder Synthesis Cadence:** Schedule quarterly/annual founder syntheses and recalibrations.

## 7. Telemetry‑Driven Oversight Activation

- **Unified Telemetry Layer Boot:** Deploy unified telemetry ingestion, storage, and analysis for all domains.
- **Oversight Dashboard Launch:** Activate real-time dashboard for board and founder oversight.
- **Synthesis-Driven Automation:** Link all synthesis layers to automated oversight and escalation triggers.

## 8. Drift‑Prevention Hardening

- **Epoch Drift Engine Boot:** Activate multi-layer drift-prevention engine; enforce CI, audit, and escalation at all synthesis layers.
- **Hardening Sprint Scheduling:** Automate quarterly hardening sprints for drift detection and correction.
- **Drift Event Routing:** Enable auto-escalation and resolution of all drift events at the appropriate synthesis layer.

## 9. Unified Operating Rhythm Synchronization

- **Cycle Synchronization:** Programmatically synchronize all weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual, and epoch cycles into a single operating rhythm.
- **Synthesis Layer Automation:** Automate scheduling, execution, and escalation for all synthesis layers.
- **Founder/Board Oversight:** Ensure all cycles, syntheses, and escalations are visible and actionable by founder and board.

**This L‑UMYOEP‑A1 activation blueprint operationalizes the 5-year unified epoch, ensuring all cycles, syntheses, and oversight mechanisms function as a single, living operating engine.**
