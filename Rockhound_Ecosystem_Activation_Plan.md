## 1. Category Activation

- **Category Definition/Lexicon/Mental Model**: Operationalize category narrative, define and propagate lexicon (FieldSession, FindLog, Specimen Graph, Mastery), embed mental model in onboarding and docs.
- **Category Pillars**: Intelligence, autonomy, continuity, mastery—manifested in product features, user flows, and messaging.
- **Category Language Deployment**: Consistent use of category terms across website, onboarding, docs, UI, and support.
- **Founder Statements**: Publish founder-led category-shaping statements; reinforce category leadership and vision.

---

## 2. Gravity Engine Activation (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Core Value Loops**: Activate capture → insight → action → mastery loops in all user flows; reinforce with feedback and progression.
- **Network Effect Surfaces**: Deploy location, specimen, and knowledge graph features; enable user contributions to network value.
- **Compounding Mechanisms**: Leverage historical data to improve predictive accuracy; surface user success stories to drive compounding engagement.
- **Continuity/Intelligence Multipliers**: Enable seamless cross-device experience; activate continuity features and cross-session intelligence.

---

## 3. Community & Growth Activation

- **Community Scaffolding**: Launch Discord, field events, leaderboards; empower early leaders and moderators.
- **Viral Surfaces**: Enable sharing of finds, hotspots, specimen stories; integrate social and community sharing tools.
- **Retention Loops**: Deploy progression, mastery, and insight features; nudge users to return and progress.
- **Telemetry-Driven Growth**: Monitor activation, retention, and virality; iterate on growth levers using telemetry insights.

---

## 4. Product Surface Activation

- **FieldSession**: Activate guidance, hotspots, revisit scoring; surface actionable insights in-session.
- **CaptureSession**: Deploy quality guidance, predictive capture, and feedback loops.
- **Intelligence Pipeline**: Enable automated classification, enrichment, and learning; surface results in user flows.
- **Dashboard**: Activate insights, trends, and mastery surfaces; enable user reflection and goal-setting.
- **Collection**: Deploy auto-categorization, long-term intelligence, and collection insights.

---

## 5. Trust & Safety Activation

- **Deterministic Trust Guarantees**: Enforce deterministic, auditable behavior in all user/system actions.
- **Transparency Surfaces**: Deploy user-visible logs, explanations, and insight provenance.
- **Autonomy Boundaries/Override**: Enforce user override and control for all autonomous actions; log all overrides.
- **Privacy/Data Stewardship**: Enforce privacy commitments, data minimization, and user control; surface stewardship policies.

---

## 6. Cross‑Ecosystem Integration

- **Lapidary Intelligence Loops**: Connect Rockhound to Lapidary’s intelligence, evolution, and governance engines.
- **Telemetry to Evolution Engine**: Route Rockhound telemetry to Lapidary evolution engine for continuous improvement.
- **Workflows to Governance/Integrity**: Ensure all Rockhound workflows comply with Lapidary governance and integrity rules.
- **Insights to Founder Cycles**: Feed Rockhound insights into founder operating cycles for roadmap and vision alignment.

---

## 7. Implementation Blueprint

- **30-Day Ecosystem Activation Plan**: Launch category language, value loops, community scaffolding, and core product surfaces.
- **90-Day Ecosystem Growth Plan**: Scale community, iterate on viral/retention loops, deepen cross-ecosystem integration.
- **Ecosystem Metrics/KPIs**: Activation, retention, DAU/MAU, share rate, network growth, mastery progression, audit log events.
- **Risk Matrix/Mitigation**: Identify risks (growth, trust, drift, privacy); assign owners, mitigation plans, and review cadence.
- **Ecosystem Evolution Roadmap**: Quarterly reviews, roadmap updates, category/narrative evolution checkpoints.

**This REAP ensures Rockhound’s ecosystem is activated as a living, user-facing, and category-defining platform, with deterministic, transparent, and compounding value loops.**
