# Lapidary Post‑Sweep Stabilization Cycle Activation Plan (L‑PSSCAP)

## 1. Purpose

Deterministically activate the L‑PSSC, transforming stabilization cycles into a living, automated, founder‑supervised system.

## 2. Activation Steps

### Weekly Loop Activation

- **CI Automation Hook:** Schedule CI to run drift/error checks (terminology, schema, template, cross‑reference) every week.
- **Audit Log Aggregation:** Automate collection and centralization of all audit, decision, and delta logs.
- **Blueprint/Activation Sync Check:** Scripted validation of activation plans against blueprints; auto‑escalate mismatches.
- **Glossary Link Audit:** Automated scan for unlinked terms in docs/code; trigger correction tasks.
- **Telemetry Ingestion:** Ingest and store system health, drift, and escalation telemetry for review.
- **Founder Oversight Workflow:** Auto‑generate weekly audit summary for founder signoff; require digital signature for drift/escalation resolutions.

### Monthly Loop Activation

- **Canon Re‑Index Automation:** Scripted re‑indexing of blueprints, activation plans, templates, and glossary; auto‑update cross‑references.
- **Template Usage Audit:** Automated audit of all logs/cycles for canonical template compliance; flag deviations.
- **Governance/Evolution Sync Routine:** Scheduled reconciliation script to align governance/evolution blueprints and cycles.
- **Integrity Checkpoint Trigger:** Auto‑recalculate and publish system integrity score; trigger escalation if below threshold.
- **Public Narrative Sync:** Scripted update of public docs/narrative to reflect current stabilization state.
- **Founder Oversight Workflow:** Auto‑generate monthly governance/evolution alignment and integrity report for founder review and signoff.

### Quarterly Loop Activation

- **Structural Improvement Sequencer:** Automated review and prioritization of structural improvements; schedule implementation tasks.
- **Drift‑Prevention Audit Automation:** Full-system scan of drift‑prevention mechanisms and CI enforcement; auto‑report findings.
- **Governance/Evolution Hardening Routine:** Scripted update/hardening of governance/evolution blueprints as needed.
- **Canon Index Publication:** Auto‑publish updated canon index and glossary.
- **Founder Oversight Workflow:** Auto‑schedule and document founder-led synthesis session, baseline recalibration, and lock‑in target setting.

## 3. Automation Hooks & Drift‑Prevention Triggers

- **CI Integration:** All checks and audits are CI‑triggered; merges blocked on failure.
- **Drift Event Triggers:** Any detected drift auto‑escalates to audit log and founder dashboard.
- **Template/Glossary Drift:** Unlinked terms or template deviations trigger correction tasks and escalation.
- **Governance/Evolution Drift:** Blueprint/cycle misalignments trigger sync routine and founder review.

## 4. Governance/Evolution Synchronization Routines

- **Scheduled Alignment Scripts:** Automated reconciliation of governance and evolution blueprints/cycles.
- **Escalation Pathways:** All misalignments or audit findings are escalated to founder and governance team for resolution.
- **Audit Log Unification:** All logs use canonical templates and are centralized for oversight.

## 5. Telemetry Ingestion & Oversight

- **Automated Telemetry Collection:** Ingest drift, escalation, integrity, and template usage signals into central telemetry store.
- **Founder Dashboard:** Real‑time dashboard for founder to review all signals, escalations, and integrity trends.
- **Oversight Workflows:** Digital signoff required for all escalations, integrity drops, and cycle completions.
