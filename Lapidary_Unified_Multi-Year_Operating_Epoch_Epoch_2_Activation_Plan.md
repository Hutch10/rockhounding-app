# Lapidary Unified Multi‑Year Operating Epoch — Epoch 2 Activation Plan (L‑UMYOEP‑E2A)

## Purpose

Deterministically activate the second 5-year epoch, initiating all governance, evolution, ecosystem, category, founder, telemetry, and drift-prevention systems for Lapidary and Rockhound.

## 1. Inter‑Epoch Governance Ignition

- **Epoch 2 Board Formation:** Constitute new governance board; define escalation, audit, and synthesis roles for the new epoch.
- **Legacy Protocol Integration:** Integrate institutional memory and legacy protocols from Epoch 1 into new governance structures.
- **Governance Synthesis Cadence:** Schedule and automate quarterly/annual syntheses and recalibrations for Epoch 2.

## 2. Next‑Generation Evolution‑Engine Activation

- **Evolution Engine Boot:** Deploy next-generation evolution engine with regenerative-to-expansive triggers and blueprint refresh.
- **Quarterly Evolution Sprints:** Automate scheduling and execution of evolution sprints; escalate major shifts to board.
- **Annual Evolution Synthesis:** Schedule annual recalibration of evolution priorities and engine parameters.

## 3. Expanded Ecosystem‑Federation Phases

- **Federation Roadmap Expansion:** Publish expanded federation roadmap; sequence new integration and partnership phases.
- **Maturity Milestone Tracking:** Automate tracking and synthesis for new federation milestones.
- **Federation Synthesis Cadence:** Schedule quarterly/annual federation syntheses and recalibrations.

## 4. Category‑Leadership Escalation

- **Category Arc Escalation:** Launch escalated category vision, language propagation, and stewardship scaling for Epoch 2.
- **Expansion Triggering:** Automate tracking and escalation of category expansion events.
- **Category Synthesis Cadence:** Schedule quarterly/annual category syntheses and recalibrations.

## 5. Architectural Founder‑Presence Structures

- **Presence Architecture Launch:** Establish founder presence as an architectural, self-sustaining system for the new epoch.
- **Presence Delegation:** Enable presence delegation and narrative propagation at scale.
- **Founder Synthesis Cadence:** Schedule quarterly/annual founder syntheses and recalibrations.

## 6. Ecosystem‑Wide Telemetry Activation

- **Unified Telemetry Layer Boot:** Deploy ecosystem-wide telemetry ingestion, storage, and analysis for all domains.
- **Oversight Dashboard Launch:** Activate real-time dashboard for board and founder oversight.
- **Synthesis-Driven Automation:** Link all synthesis layers to automated oversight and escalation triggers.

## 7. Regenerative‑to‑Expansive Drift‑Prevention Transition

- **Drift Engine Transition:** Transition drift-prevention from regenerative to expansive mode; focus on system growth and resilience.
- **Hardening Sprint Scheduling:** Automate quarterly hardening sprints for drift detection and correction.
- **Drift Event Routing:** Enable auto-escalation and resolution of all drift events at the appropriate synthesis layer.

## 8. Synchronization Directives

- **Cycle Synchronization:** Programmatically synchronize all weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual, and epoch cycles to the new epoch’s strategic horizon.
- **Synthesis Layer Automation:** Automate scheduling, execution, and escalation for all synthesis layers.
- **Founder/Board Oversight:** Ensure all cycles, syntheses, and escalations are visible and actionable by founder and board.

**This L‑UMYOEP‑E2A activation blueprint initiates the second 5-year epoch, ensuring all systems, syntheses, and oversight mechanisms are aligned with the new epoch’s strategic horizon.**
