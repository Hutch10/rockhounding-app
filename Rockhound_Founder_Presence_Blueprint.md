## 1. Founder Voice & Identity

- **Core Voice Pillars**: Clarity (direct, unambiguous), Mastery (expertise, humility), Determinism (precision, reliability), Curiosity (exploration, learning).
- **Tone Guidelines**: Confident but approachable; transparent but measured; visionary but grounded; always user-centric.
- **Narrative Boundaries/Non-Negotiables**: No hype, no overpromising, no jargon; always deterministic, privacy-first, and user-empowering.
- **Founder Archetype/Identity Arc**: The Field Architect—builder, guide, steward; evolves from pioneer to ecosystem leader, always learning and teaching.

---

## 2. Communication Cadence (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Daily Micro-Updates**: Short build notes, field insights, technical learnings; shared via social and community channels.
- **Weekly Founder Letters**: Progress, philosophy, roadmap deltas; published on website and to community.
- **Monthly Narrative Anchors**: Category shaping, ecosystem gravity, user stories; reinforce long-term vision.
- **Quarterly Vision Statements**: Direction, evolution, horizon thinking; align team, community, and ecosystem.

---

## 3. Public Channels & Formats

- **Website Founder Section**: Bio, vision, ongoing letters, Q&A.
- **Launch Announcement Voice**: Deterministic, mission-driven, user-first; clear articulation of category and promise.
- **Social Content Patterns**: Short-form (insights, tips), long-form (essays, field stories), visual (photos, diagrams, fieldwork).
- **Community Presence**: Active in Discord, field events, regular Q&A; visible, accessible, responsive.
- **Press/Interviews**: Consistent positioning, narrative control, reinforce category and vision.

---

## 4. Narrative Stewardship

- **Maintaining Category Clarity**: Reiterate category definition, pillars, and value loops in all communications.
- **Reinforcing Mental Model**: Use consistent language, metaphors, and product stories; educate through repetition and example.
- **Evolving Without Drift**: Anchor all narrative evolution to core pillars; review and refine regularly; address misalignment directly.
- **Handling External Interpretation**: Monitor, clarify, and correct public misinterpretations; engage constructively with critics.

---

## 5. Trust, Transparency & Leadership Guarantees

- **Deterministic Communication Rules**: All public statements are precise, auditable, and consistent with product reality.
- **Transparency Boundaries**: Share progress, philosophy, and vision; hold sensitive, competitive, or user data private.
- **Reliability/Consistency**: Founder presence is regular, predictable, and responsive; no unexplained absences.
- **Crisis Communication**: Immediate, transparent, and stabilizing; acknowledge, explain, correct, and update.

---

## 6. Architecture Diagrams (Text-Described)

- **Founder Communication Loop**: Build/learn → share (micro/letter/anchor/vision) → feedback → refine → repeat.
- **Narrative Evolution Map**: Core pillars → narrative anchors → public feedback → review/refine → next anchor.
- **Category Stewardship Flow**: Category definition → public reinforcement → user education → ecosystem adoption → feedback loop.
- **Trust/Transparency Layering**: Public statements → audit log → privacy guardrails → crisis protocols.

---

## 7. Implementation Blueprint

- **Templates**: Daily (micro-update), weekly (letter), monthly (anchor), quarterly (vision statement).
- **Founder Presence Rituals**: Scheduled writing, field engagement, community Q&A, narrative review.
- **Narrative Review/Refinement Cycle**: Monthly review of all public content; update anchors and correct drift.
- **Metrics**: Narrative resonance (engagement, shares, sentiment), ecosystem impact (growth, retention, category mentions).

**This FPB ensures a deterministic, resonant, and trust-centered founder presence, sustaining Rockhound’s category leadership and narrative clarity over the long term.**
