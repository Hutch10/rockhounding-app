---

## 1. Weekly Activation Loop

- **Founder Rituals**: Review previous week, set priorities, commit to actions, execute and track progress.
- **Architecture Delta Review**: Identify and log all architecture changes, regressions, and improvements.
- **Telemetry/Intelligence Drift Scan**: Analyze telemetry for anomalies, drift, and intelligence model performance.
- **Sync/Offline Engine Health Check**: Monitor latency, error rates, queue depth, and recovery; address issues immediately.
- **Narrative/Communication Cadence**: Publish internal notes, roadmap deltas, and public updates as scheduled.
- **Weekly Decision Log Update**: Record all key decisions, rationale, and follow-ups in a structured log.

---

## 2. Monthly Activation Loop (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Platform Integrity Audit**: Validate determinism, replay safety, auditability; run chaos/edge tests; review event logs.
- **Documentation Delta Consolidation**: Merge doc changes, update onboarding/architecture docs, publish deltas.
- **Ecosystem Intelligence Review**: Analyze behavioral trends, predictive accuracy, model drift; update models as needed.
- **Category Alignment Check**: Ensure narrative, product, and ecosystem remain aligned with category vision.
- **Infrastructure Scaling Checkpoint**: Review storage, telemetry, sync queues; plan scaling and optimization.
- **Founder Presence Refinement**: Review and refine public presence, voice, and leadership rituals.

---

## 3. Quarterly Activation Loop

- **Long-Horizon Platform Direction Review**: Assess and update 1, 3, 10-year vision; align product and platform strategy.
- **Intelligence Model Recalibration**: Re-weight features, tune heuristics, integrate new ML models; validate with golden datasets.
- **Product Portfolio Planning**: Sequence Rockhound, next product, and ecosystem services; allocate resources, set milestones.
- **Governance/Integrity Audit**: Deep-dive audits of data, intelligence, autonomy, sync, and telemetry integrity.
- **Evolution Backlog Reprioritization**: Review and reprioritize evolution backlog; address high-impact items.
- **Founder Vision Statement Update**: Publish updated vision statement; communicate direction to team and ecosystem.

---

## 4. Cross‑Cycle Integration Surfaces

- **Cycle Reinforcement**: Weekly loops feed monthly audits; monthly audits inform quarterly evolution; quarterly direction sets weekly priorities.
- **Telemetry → Decisions**: Telemetry/metrics drive all cycles; feedback loops ensure data-driven ops.
- **User Behavior → Models**: User actions/feedback shape predictive models; model drift triggers recalibration.
- **Architecture Drift → Correction**: Detected drift triggers review, correction, and log update.
- **Rockhound Insights → Lapidary Evolution**: Product learnings from Rockhound inform Lapidary platform and future products.

---

## 5. Activation Tools & Templates

- **Weekly Ritual Template**: Priorities, key metrics, blockers, wins, drift flags, corrective actions, commitments.
- **Monthly Audit Template**: Platform health, architecture checks, intelligence review, doc deltas, scaling checkpoints.
- **Quarterly Evolution Template**: Direction review, model recalibration, portfolio planning, governance audit, backlog reprioritization.
- **Decision Log Structure**: Date, context, decision, rationale, owner, follow-up.
- **Architecture Delta Log**: Date, subsystem, change, drift detected, correction, status.
- **Telemetry Review Dashboard Outline**: Usage, model accuracy, sync health, drift, category metrics.

---

## 6. Reliability & Leadership Guarantees

- **Deterministic Operating Behavior**: All cycles, reviews, and actions follow defined templates and rules; no ad hoc drift.
- **No-Drift Leadership Rules**: All deviations from plan logged, reviewed, and corrected; vision continuity enforced.
- **Transparency/Auditability**: All decisions, corrections, and deltas logged; accessible for review and audit.
- **Continuity of Vision**: Quarterly direction cascades to monthly/weekly cycles; all actions traceable to vision and platform strategy.

**This L‑FOCAP ensures Lapidary’s founder operating cycle is a living, deterministic, and adaptive execution rhythm, supporting robust, transparent, and no-drift platform leadership.**
