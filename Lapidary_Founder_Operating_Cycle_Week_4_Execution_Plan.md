# Lapidary Founder Operating Cycle — Week 4 Execution Plan (L‑FOC‑W4)

---

## 1. Week 3 → Week 4 Transition

- **Synthesize Week 3 Outcomes**: Review platform, governance, evolution, ecosystem, and founder presence results.
- **Integrate Remaining Deltas**: Carry forward all outstanding architecture, process, and decision deltas; update logs and plans.
- **Escalate Unresolved Issues**: Flag major risks, drift, or unresolved issues for monthly review.
- **Reset Governance/Integrity/Evolution Surfaces**: Re-initialize enforcement, audit, and evolution protocols for new week.
- **Establish Week 4 Integration Posture**: Focus on consolidation, integration, and alignment with upcoming monthly cycle.

---

## 2. Weekly Objectives (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Platform Stability Consolidation**: Validate all core services; address regressions; ensure no critical errors.
- **Governance Enforcement/Integrity Reinforcement**: Enforce policies, run audits, address exceptions, update documentation.
- **Evolution Engine Stabilization/Drift Correction**: Tune evolution pipelines, recalibrate models, address drift triggers, update backlog.
- **Rockhound Ecosystem Integration/Growth Alignment**: Integrate new features, align growth levers, reinforce community scaffolding.
- **Founder Presence Refinement/Narrative Tightening**: Refine communication, deepen narrative, reinforce category leadership.

---

## 3. Daily Execution Rhythm

- **Day 1**: Synthesize Week 3, integrate deltas, update logs, set Week 4 priorities.
- **Day 2**: Enforce governance, harden policies, run integrity checks, log exceptions.
- **Day 3**: Scan for intelligence/model drift, stabilize evolution tasks, update model registry.
- **Day 4**: Execute ecosystem integration/growth tasks, align category language and community.
- **Day 5**: Refine founder presence (micro-update, Q&A, narrative post), tighten narrative, review communication cadence.
- **Day 6**: Review telemetry, validate predictive accuracy, extract insights, trigger evolution as needed.
- **Day 7**: Synthesize week, evaluate outcomes, refine processes, prepare for monthly cycle, plan Week 5.

---

## 4. Decision Log Continuation

- **Decisions to Log**: All platform, governance, evolution, ecosystem, and narrative decisions.
- **Cross-Week Continuity**: Reference prior weeks; maintain decision threads and rationale.
- **Escalation Rules**: Flag decisions for monthly/quarterly cycles as needed.
- **Auditability/Transparency**: All entries versioned, cross-referenced, and reviewable.

---

## 5. Architecture Delta Log Continuation

- **Deltas to Capture**: All architecture, model, and process changes; classify and log.
- **Drift Detection**: Apply drift detection rules; flag and address anomalies.
- **Integration**: Feed deltas into monthly cycle planning and evolution backlog.
- **Cross-Cycle Propagation**: Ensure deltas are visible across weekly, monthly, and quarterly cycles.

---

## 6. Telemetry & Intelligence Review

- **Signals**: Monitor platform health, sync/queue status, model accuracy, user engagement, error rates.
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Checkpoints for model performance, user feedback, and correction rates.
- **Evolution Stabilization Triggers**: Log triggers for recalibration, refactoring, or process improvement.
- **Ecosystem Intelligence**: Extract insights for product, community, and growth optimization.

---

## 7. Founder Presence Execution

- **Daily Micro-Updates**: Themes—build progress, insights, field learnings, community highlights, narrative anchors.
- **Weekly Letter**: Outline—progress, philosophy, roadmap deltas, category narrative, next steps.
- **Narrative Alignment**: Daily/weekly review for consistency with category pillars and mental model.
- **Category Stewardship**: Reinforce category language, respond to community, clarify vision.

---

## 8. End-of-Week Synthesis & Monthly Cycle Prep

- **Evaluate**: Platform stability, governance compliance, evolution progress, ecosystem activation, founder presence.
- **Refine**: Adjust processes, update templates, address gaps.
- **Carry Forward**: Outstanding actions, unresolved issues, new insights.
- **Escalate**: Major issues, drift, or risks to monthly strategic cycle for deeper review.
- **Prepare for Month 2 Activation**: Review monthly objectives, align team, update roadmap, set vision for next cycle.

**This L‑FOC‑W4 ensures Lapidary’s founder operating cycle completes its first month with deterministic, auditable, and high-throughput execution, consolidating stability and preparing for the next evolution phase.**
