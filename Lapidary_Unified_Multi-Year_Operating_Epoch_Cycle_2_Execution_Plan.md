# Lapidary Unified Multi‑Year Operating Epoch — Cycle 2 Execution Plan (L‑UMYOEP‑C2)

## Purpose

Deterministically execute the second full cycle of the activated 5-year epoch, advancing all epoch-level and subordinate cycles in a unified, oversight-driven rhythm.

## 1. Epoch‑Level Governance Actions

- **Board Session:** Convene epoch governance board to review Cycle 1 outcomes, update escalation protocols, and recalibrate synthesis cadence.
- **Blueprint/Template Update:** Review and, if needed, update canonical blueprints, templates, and cycles; publish revised canon index.
- **Escalation Review:** Audit all escalation events from Cycle 1; resolve outstanding issues and refine escalation pathways.

## 2. Evolution‑Engine Progression

- **Engine Progression:** Advance the 5-year evolution engine; trigger next set of blueprint, system, and self-improvement upgrades.
- **Quarterly Evolution Sprint:** Continue/complete current evolution sprint; log changes and escalate major shifts.
- **Annual Evolution Synthesis Prep:** Refine parameters and prepare for upcoming annual evolution synthesis.

## 3. Ecosystem‑Federation Advancement

- **Federation Phase 2 Launch:** Initiate next phase of ecosystem federation; activate new partnership and integration triggers.
- **Milestone Advancement:** Track and escalate progress on federation maturity milestones; resolve blockers.
- **Federation Synthesis:** Conduct quarterly federation synthesis and recalibration.

## 4. Category‑Leadership Expansion

- **Category Arc Progression:** Advance category expansion and language propagation tasks; launch new initiatives as needed.
- **Expansion Milestone Tracking:** Continue automated tracking and escalation of category expansion events.
- **Category Synthesis:** Conduct quarterly category synthesis and recalibration.

## 5. Founder‑Presence Scaling

- **Epoch Cadence Scaling:** Founder executes next epoch presence ritual and public narrative update; expand presence delegation.
- **Presence Impact Review:** Assess impact of presence/narrative scaling; adjust delegation as needed.
- **Founder Synthesis:** Conduct quarterly founder synthesis and recalibration.

## 6. Telemetry‑Driven Oversight Routines

- **Telemetry Review:** Ingest and analyze all system, governance, evolution, and ecosystem telemetry for Cycle 2.
- **Dashboard Monitoring:** Board and founder review real-time signals, escalations, and trends; trigger oversight actions as needed.
- **Synthesis-Driven Actions:** Execute oversight actions based on telemetry at all synthesis layers.

## 7. Drift‑Prevention Enforcement

- **Drift Engine Enforcement:** Continue CI, audit, and escalation for drift detection and correction at all synthesis layers.
- **Hardening Sprint:** Conduct quarterly drift-prevention hardening sprint; implement improvements.
- **Drift Event Routing:** Ensure all drift events are auto-escalated and resolved at the correct synthesis layer.

## 8. Subordinate Cycle Synchronization

- **Cycle Sync Engine:** Maintain synchronization of all weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual cycles to the epoch rhythm.
- **Synthesis Layer Execution:** Automate scheduling and execution of all subordinate syntheses; escalate blockers.
- **Founder/Board Oversight:** Ensure all cycles, syntheses, and escalations are visible and actionable by founder and board.

**This L‑UMYOEP‑C2 plan ensures deterministic, unified execution of the second cycle of the 5-year epoch, advancing all governance, evolution, ecosystem, category, founder, and oversight actions in a single operating rhythm.**
