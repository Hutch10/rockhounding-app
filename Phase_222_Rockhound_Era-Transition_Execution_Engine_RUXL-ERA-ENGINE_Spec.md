# Phase 222 — Rockhound Era-Transition Execution Engine (RUXL-ERA-ENGINE)

## Deterministic, Regeneration-Safe Era-Transition Execution Specification

---

### 1. Era-Transition Execution Architecture

- **Execution Model:** Era transitions are executed via deterministic, canon-governed state machines; all steps versioned and auditable.
- **Transition Sequencing:** All transitions follow deterministic, rollback-capable sequences; no partial or orphaned transitions.
- **Transition Constraints:** Canon rules enforce safety, invariants, and continuity at every step.
- **Multi-Device/Engine Rules:** All transitions validated for device and engine compatibility; propagation is synchronized and versioned.
- **Fallback/Rollback:** All transitions are rollback- and fallback-capable; no data loss or drift.

---

### 2. Era-Change Detection & Classification

- **Boundary Detection:** Era boundaries detected deterministically via canon-aligned triggers and state checks.
- **Transition Classification:** All transitions classified as minor, major, or generational; impact and risk assessed.
- **Impact Assessment:** Cross-engine impact analysis performed before transition execution; dependency graph traversed.
- **Dependency Graph Traversal:** Multi-era dependency graph traversed to validate all dependencies and invariants.
- **Replay-Safe Logs:** All detection and classification events are logged immutably and replay-safe.

---

### 3. Transition Propagation Engine

- **Propagation Rules:** Engineering, canon, and intelligence updates propagate via deterministic, canon-governed rules.
- **Safe Sequences:** All propagation sequences are rollback- and fallback-capable; no unvalidated propagation.
- **Drift/Invariants:** Drift-prevention and invariant enforcement at every propagation step; no drift tolerated.
- **Offline/Field Constraints:** Propagation logic is offline-first and field-mode aware; syncs when connectivity resumes.
- **Continuity Guarantees:** Multi-device, multi-engine continuity enforced throughout propagation.

---

### 4. Cross-Engine Era Synchronization

- **ENG↔CANON↔INTEL Alignment:** All engines synchronize state and dependencies deterministically during transitions.
- **Intelligence Evolution:** Canon-governed intelligence evolution; all changes versioned and auditable.
- **Engineering Continuity:** Engineering implementation continuity validated at every transition checkpoint.
- **Intelligence Consistency:** Multi-era intelligence consistency checks; no unvalidated propagation.
- **Device-Class Evolution:** Device-class evolution handled via deterministic adaptation and compatibility checks.

---

### 5. Long-Horizon Evolution Execution

- **Evolution Cycles:** Seasonal, geological, and environmental evolution cycles executed via deterministic triggers.
- **Intelligence Upgrades:** Intelligence-generation upgrades executed with constraint-bound, rollback-capable logic.
- **Performance Baselines:** Multi-era performance baselines enforced and regression-tested at every transition.
- **Founder Oversight:** Founder checkpoints integrated at all major evolution events; all actions auditable.
- **Regeneration Across Eras:** All regeneration logic is deterministic, versioned, and rollback-capable.

---

### 6. Observability & Oversight

- **Telemetry:** Real-time era-transition telemetry; cross-engine, cross-era visibility.
- **Anomaly Detection/Alerting:** Automated anomaly detection and canon-governed alerting.
- **Audit Trails:** Immutable, canon-aligned audit trails for all transitions.
- **Dashboards:** Founder-grade dashboards for oversight and review.
- **Transition History:** Multi-era, device-class transition history; deterministic event tracing.

---

### 7. Output Requirements

- Ultra-dense, deterministic, single-pass, regeneration-safe
- Canonical JSON + human-readable spec
- No filler, no drift
