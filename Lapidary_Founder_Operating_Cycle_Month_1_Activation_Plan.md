# Lapidary Founder Operating Cycle — Month 1 Activation Plan (L‑FOC‑M1)

## Purpose

Deterministically activate the first month of the founder operating cycle, ensuring continuous governance, evolution, ecosystem, category-leadership, and founder presence postures, with explicit founder syntheses, rhythms, and escalation paths.

## Monthly Structure

- **Monthly Governance Posture:** Founder sets and publishes governance focus, escalation protocols, and integrity standards for the month.
- **Monthly Evolution Posture:** Founder defines evolution priorities, blueprint update cadence, and self-improvement targets for the month.
- **Monthly Ecosystem Posture:** Founder establishes ecosystem engagement, partnership, and category expansion goals for the month.
- **Monthly Category-Leadership Posture:** Founder articulates category vision, language propagation, and stewardship commitments for the month.
- **Monthly Founder Presence Posture:** Founder commits to public narrative, presence rituals, and cadence templates for the month.
- **Monthly Founder Synthesis:** Founder leads a synthesis session, recalibrates the operating baseline, and sets direction for the next month.

## Weekly Founder Rhythms

- **Weekly Leadership Review:** Founder reviews audit logs, drift/escalation events, and integrity signals.
- **Weekly Blueprint/Activation Sync:** Confirm all blueprints and activation plans remain aligned; escalate mismatches.
- **Weekly Ecosystem/Category Pulse:** Monitor ecosystem signals, category language, and stewardship actions.
- **Weekly Founder Presence:** Founder executes weekly presence routine and narrative update.

## Escalation Paths

- **Drift/Escalation Events:** All drift or escalation events are auto-logged and routed to founder dashboard for review and resolution.
- **Audit Log Review:** Founder reviews and signs off on all escalations and integrity signals weekly.
- **Public Narrative Escalation:** Any deviation from cadence or narrative triggers immediate review and correction.

## Founder-Level Oversight Actions

- Weekly and monthly review and signoff on all posture, synthesis, cadence, and escalation events.
- Monthly founder synthesis sets direction and recalibrates operating baseline for the next month.
