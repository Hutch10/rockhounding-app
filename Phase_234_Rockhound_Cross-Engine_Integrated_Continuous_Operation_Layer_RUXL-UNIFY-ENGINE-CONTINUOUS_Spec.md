# Phase 234 — Rockhound Cross-Engine Integrated Continuous Operation Layer (RUXL-UNIFY-ENGINE-CONTINUOUS)

## Deterministic, Regeneration-Safe Cross-Engine Integrated Continuous Operation Specification

---

### 1. Architecture

- **Unified Continuous-Operation Model:** Canon-governed, versioned model unifies continuous operation across ENG, CANON, and INTEL engines; no operational gaps.
- **Substrate-Level Continuity Rules:** Deterministic continuity rules ensure seamless propagation and state integrity across recursion ladders and engine domains; all transitions versioned and auditable.
- **Global Engine Invariants/Meta-Stability Constraints:** All invariants and meta-stability constraints enforced at substrate scale; no drift or unvalidated transitions.
- **Dependency Graph/Propagation:** Explicit, versioned dependency graph for all cross-engine components; deterministic propagation logic across substrate.

---

### 2. Engine / Execution Layer

- **Unified Engine Substrate Integration:** Unified engine substrate is integrated into the continuous runtime; all cycles are substrate-aware and canon-governed.
- **Sequencing/Triggers:** All cross-engine cycles follow deterministic, rollback- and fallback-capable sequences; triggers are canon-governed and auditable.
- **ENG↔CANON↔INTEL Sync:** Synchronization across all engines and recursion scales; all state changes validated and versioned.
- **Safe Propagation:** Intelligence, canon, and engineering updates propagate safely and deterministically through the substrate; rollback on failure.

---

### 3. Stability & Safety

- **Drift Detection/Correction:** Automated, deterministic drift detection and correction at every substrate boundary and within engines.
- **Invariant Enforcement:** UX, UI, data, and intelligence invariants enforced at substrate scale; no drift or unvalidated transitions.
- **Degraded-Mode:** Deterministic degraded-mode behavior for all cross-engine transitions; all actions rollback-capable.
- **Regeneration/Rollback:** All regeneration and rollback logic is deterministic, versioned, and auditable for substrate-aware continuous operation.

---

### 4. Performance & Reliability

- **Latency/Throughput:** ≤2s unified engine cycle latency; ≥99.999% successful cycles; resource usage bounded by device class and substrate context.
- **Multi-Device/Offline-First/Field-Mode:** All logic operates offline-first and field-mode aware; syncs and validations occur when connectivity resumes.
- **Long-Horizon Optimization:** Scheduled, deterministic optimization cycles across substrate lifecycles; performance baselines enforced.

---

### 5. Observability & Oversight

- **Telemetry Schema:** Real-time, versioned telemetry for all cross-engine integrated operations; all events and anomalies logged.
- **Dashboards/Alerts:** Founder-grade dashboards; canon-governed alerts and anomaly detection at substrate scale.
- **Oversight Rhythm:** Founder oversight integrated into all substrate-aware cycles; all actions auditable and reviewable.

### 6. Output Requirements

- Ultra-dense, deterministic, single-pass, regeneration-safe
- Canonical JSON + human-readable spec
- No filler, no drift
