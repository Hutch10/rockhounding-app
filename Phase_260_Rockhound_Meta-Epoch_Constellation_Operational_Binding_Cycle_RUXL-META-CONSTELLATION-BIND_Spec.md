## Human-Readable: Meta-Epoch Constellation Binding Cycle (Ultra-Dense, Parallel Micro-Phases)

### A. Binding Cycle Definition & Scope

- Purpose: unify all execution engines, synchronize all cycles, enforce constellation invariants, ensure long-horizon stability/operation
- Boundaries: no new product features, only meta-operational integration

### B. Global State Synchronization Layer

- Rules: cross-engine state propagation, cycle boundary transitions, long-horizon state retention
- Acceptance: all engines share a single coherent global state

### C. Cross-Cycle Scheduling Engine

- Rules: schedule build/release/field-test/evolution cycles, deterministic priority, conflict resolution
- Acceptance: all cycles operate without contention/drift

### D. Constellation Invariant Enforcement

- Invariants: determinism, regeneration safety, cross-device continuity, forward/backward compatibility, long-horizon evolution
- Acceptance: invariants hold across all engines/cycles

### E. Meta-Epoch Integration Layer

- Bind: global substrate, execution engines, field-test triad, evolution cycle, constellation continuous-operation layer
- Acceptance: system behaves as a single meta-epoch organism

### F. Failure Mode Containment & Recovery

- Rules: cross-engine failure detection, cascade prevention, global rollback, deterministic recovery
- Acceptance: no failure in one engine destabilizes the constellation

### G. Long-Horizon Evolution Loop

- Rules: multi-cycle evolution, cross-version compatibility, meta-level telemetry, constellation-scale optimization
- Acceptance: Rockhound evolves safely across epochs

### H. Canonical JSON Binding Cycle Schema

- Output: full binding cycle as canonical JSON (engines, cycles, invariants, transitions, recovery, evolution)
