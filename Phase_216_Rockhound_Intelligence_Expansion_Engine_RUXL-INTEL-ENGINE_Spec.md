# Phase 216 — Rockhound Intelligence Expansion Engine (RUXL-INTEL-ENGINE)

## Deterministic, Regeneration-Safe Intelligence Expansion Specification

---

### 1. Intelligence Architecture Expansion

- **Multi-Layer Scoring Model:** Surface, subsurface, and contextual scoring; explainable, versioned, and deterministic.
- **Geological Inference Engine:** Enhanced mineralogical, geological, and environmental inference; explainable logic and versioned models.
- **Seasonal/Environmental Intelligence:** Dynamic overlays and advisories; deterministic update hooks for season/weather.
- **Hazard/Weather Intelligence:** Expanded hazard/advisory overlays; severity, timing, and context-aware logic.
- **Confidence/Uncertainty Modeling:** Improved rationale, confidence, and uncertainty surfaces; deterministic fallback logic.

---

### 2. Intelligence Data Pipeline

- **Data Ingestion/Preprocessing:** Canonical, versioned ingestion rules; deterministic normalization and enrichment.
- **Local Device Caching:** On-device intelligence cache; offline-first, deterministic replay and update.
- **Cross-Device Consistency:** All intelligence outputs consistent across devices and eras; deterministic sync and merge.
- **Offline-First Behavior:** All intelligence available offline; queued updates and deterministic replay on reconnect.
- **Versioning/Rollback:** All intelligence logic and data versioned; rollback and deterministic regeneration supported.

---

### 3. Predictive Overlay Expansion

- **Multi-Resolution Heatmaps:** Dynamic, zoom-level-aware overlays; deterministic rendering.
- **Locality Alert Precision:** Improved spatial/temporal precision; deterministic alert logic.
- **Hazard/Advisory Overlays:** Enhanced overlays for hazards, advisories, and context; severity and rationale always accessible.
- **Temporal Overlays:** Seasonal and weather-linked overlays; deterministic update and fallback.
- **Field-Mode Optimization:** All overlays and intelligence surfaces optimized for field-mode constraints.

---

### 4. Intelligence Loop Integration

- **ENG-ENGINE Integration:** Intelligence hooks and constraints wired to engineering implementation (Phase 214).
- **CANON-ENGINE Integration:** All intelligence logic and data validated against canon constraints (Phase 215).
- **Deterministic Constraints:** All intelligence logic bounded by canon invariants; no drift or regression.
- **Multi-Era/Multi-Device Alignment:** All intelligence outputs aligned across eras and devices; deterministic compatibility.
- **Safety Rails/Fallback:** All intelligence logic bounded by explainability, risk thresholds, and user override.

---

### 5. Performance & Reliability

- **On-Device Inference:** Performance targets for latency, battery, and memory; deterministic benchmarks.
- **Battery/Memory Constraints:** ≤5%/hr battery drain (field mode), ≤200MB RAM (mobile).
- **Degraded-Mode Behavior:** Deterministic fallback overlays and messaging in degraded states.
- **Sync/Update Reliability:** All intelligence updates and syncs deterministic, replay-safe, and recoverable.
- **Long-Horizon Evolution:** Scheduled, versioned, explainable intelligence upgrades; deterministic migration and rollback.

---

### 6. Output Requirements

- Ultra-dense, deterministic, single-pass, regeneration-safe
- Canonical JSON + human-readable spec
- No filler, no drift
