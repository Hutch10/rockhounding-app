# Lapidary Unified Multi‑Year Operating Epoch — Cycle 1 Execution Plan (L‑UMYOEP‑C1)

## Purpose

Deterministically execute the first full cycle of the activated 5-year epoch, operationalizing all epoch-level and subordinate cycles in a unified, oversight-driven rhythm.

## 1. Epoch‑Level Governance Actions

- **Board Convening:** Hold inaugural epoch governance board session; confirm roles, escalation protocols, and synthesis cadence.
- **Canonical Blueprint Review:** Validate and lock all blueprints, templates, and cycles for the epoch; publish canon index.
- **Escalation Pathways:** Activate multi-layer escalation and audit log routing; ensure all events are board-visible.

## 2. Evolution‑Engine Execution

- **Engine Kickoff:** Launch the 5-year evolution engine; activate initial blueprint, system, and self-improvement triggers.
- **Quarterly Evolution Sprint:** Schedule and begin first evolution sprint; log all changes and escalate major shifts.
- **Annual Evolution Synthesis Prep:** Set parameters and schedule for first annual evolution synthesis.

## 3. Ecosystem‑Federation Progression

- **Federation Phase 1 Launch:** Initiate first phase of ecosystem federation; activate partnership and integration triggers.
- **Milestone Tracking:** Begin automated tracking of federation maturity milestones; escalate blockers.
- **Federation Synthesis:** Schedule first quarterly federation synthesis and recalibration.

## 4. Category‑Leadership Expansion Tasks

- **Category Arc Activation:** Launch first set of category expansion and language propagation tasks.
- **Expansion Milestone Tracking:** Automate tracking and escalation of category expansion events.
- **Category Synthesis:** Schedule first quarterly category synthesis and recalibration.

## 5. Founder‑Presence Enactment

- **Epoch Cadence Initiation:** Founder executes first epoch presence ritual and public narrative update.
- **Presence Delegation:** Begin delegation of presence/narrative as system scales.
- **Founder Synthesis:** Schedule first quarterly founder synthesis and recalibration.

## 6. Telemetry‑Driven Oversight Routines

- **Unified Telemetry Boot:** Activate ingestion and analysis of all system, governance, evolution, and ecosystem telemetry.
- **Oversight Dashboard Monitoring:** Board and founder review real-time signals, escalations, and trends.
- **Synthesis-Driven Actions:** Trigger oversight actions based on telemetry at all synthesis layers.

## 7. Drift‑Prevention Enforcement

- **Drift Engine Activation:** Enforce CI, audit, and escalation for drift detection and correction at all synthesis layers.
- **Hardening Sprint Launch:** Begin first quarterly drift-prevention hardening sprint.
- **Drift Event Routing:** Ensure all drift events are auto-escalated and resolved at the correct synthesis layer.

## 8. Subordinate Cycle Synchronization

- **Cycle Sync Engine:** Programmatically synchronize all weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual cycles to the epoch rhythm.
- **Synthesis Layer Execution:** Automate scheduling and execution of all subordinate syntheses; escalate blockers.
- **Founder/Board Oversight:** Ensure all cycles, syntheses, and escalations are visible and actionable by founder and board.

**This L‑UMYOEP‑C1 plan ensures deterministic, unified execution of the first cycle of the 5-year epoch, integrating all governance, evolution, ecosystem, category, founder, and oversight actions into a single operating rhythm.**
