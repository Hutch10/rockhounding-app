# Lapidary Activated Stabilization Cycle — Year 1 Execution Plan (L‑ASC‑Y1)

## Purpose

Deterministically execute the full 12-month horizon of the activated post‑sweep stabilization cycle, ensuring continuous lock‑in, drift‑prevention, improvement integration, and founder‑level oversight.

## Daily Tasks (Mon–Fri)

- **Telemetry Ingestion:** Ingest system health, drift, and escalation signals.
- **System Monitoring:** Passive monitoring of telemetry, drift, and escalation signals.
- **Founder Oversight:** Founder receives daily summary of system health and any critical events.

## Weekly Tasks

- **CI Drift/Integrity Check:** Automated CI checks for terminology, schema, template, and cross‑reference drift (Mondays, Fridays).
- **Audit Log Aggregation:** Collect and centralize all audit, decision, and delta logs (Mondays).
- **Blueprint/Activation Sync:** Scripted validation of all activation plans against blueprints; auto‑escalate mismatches (Tuesdays).
- **Template Usage Audit:** Check all logs/cycles for canonical template compliance; flag deviations (Tuesdays).
- **Drift‑Prevention Trigger Test:** Simulate drift event; verify auto‑escalation and correction workflow (Wednesdays).
- **Governance/Evolution Sync:** Run scheduled reconciliation script; confirm alignment (Wednesdays).
- **Structural Improvement Integration:** Identify, prioritize, and implement improvements (Wednesdays/Thursdays).
- **Integrity Score Update:** Auto‑recalculate system integrity score; review for drops or anomalies (Thursdays).
- **Public Narrative Sync:** Update public docs/narrative to reflect current stabilization and improvement state (Thursdays).
- **Telemetry Review:** Analyze trend of drift, escalation, and integrity signals (Thursdays).
- **Weekly Audit Log Synthesis:** Aggregate and synthesize all audit, decision, and delta logs for the week (Fridays).
- **Final Drift/Template Audit:** Run end-of-week CI checks for drift and template compliance (Fridays).
- **Governance/Evolution Confirmation:** Confirm all cycles and blueprints remain in sync (Fridays).
- **Structural Improvement Review:** Evaluate effectiveness of integrated improvements; document outcomes (Fridays).
- **Founder Oversight:** Daily review and signoff on all critical results, escalations, integrity signals, and improvement progress; end-of-week synthesis and confirmation.

## Monthly Tasks

- **Canon Re‑Index:** Scripted re‑indexing of blueprints, activation plans, templates, and glossary; auto‑update cross‑references.
- **Template Usage Audit:** Automated audit of all logs/cycles for canonical template compliance; flag deviations.
- **Governance/Evolution Sync Routine:** Scheduled reconciliation script to align governance/evolution blueprints and cycles.
- **Integrity Checkpoint:** Auto‑recalculate and publish system integrity score; trigger escalation if below threshold.
- **Public Narrative Sync:** Scripted update of public docs/narrative to reflect current stabilization state.
- **Structural Improvement Review:** Evaluate and document effectiveness of all improvements integrated during the month.
- **Founder Oversight:** Founder reviews and signs off on monthly synthesis, integrity checkpoint, and improvement outcomes.

## Quarterly Tasks

- **Full-System Drift‑Prevention Audit:** Comprehensive audit of all drift‑prevention mechanisms, CI enforcement, and escalation pathways.
- **Governance/Evolution Hardening:** Update and harden governance/evolution blueprints as needed.
- **Canon Index Publication:** Publish updated canon index and glossary.
- **Structural Improvement Synthesis:** Synthesize and document all improvements and their impact.
- **Integrity Score Recalibration:** Recalculate and publish system integrity score for the quarter.
- **Founder Synthesis Session:** Founder leads synthesis, recalibrates baseline, and sets next‑quarter lock‑in targets.

## Annual Synthesis (End of Year)

- **Full-System Review:** Comprehensive review of all stabilization, drift-prevention, and improvement activities.
- **Annual Canon Re‑Index:** Re-index and publish all blueprints, activation plans, templates, and glossary.
- **Annual Integrity Score Publication:** Publish annual system integrity score and trend analysis.
- **Annual Structural Improvement Synthesis:** Synthesize and document all improvements and their cumulative impact.
- **Governance/Evolution Blueprint Update:** Major update and hardening of governance/evolution blueprints.
- **Founder Annual Synthesis:** Founder leads annual synthesis session, recalibrates operating baseline, and sets next-year lock-in targets.

## Automation & Verification

- All checks and audits are CI‑triggered and block merges on failure.
- Drift events auto‑escalate to audit log and founder dashboard.
- All logs use canonical templates; deviations trigger correction tasks.
- Telemetry signals ingested daily and reviewed by founder.
- Governance/evolution sync and escalation pathways confirmed weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually.
- Structural improvements tracked and verified for impact.

## Founder‑Level Oversight Actions

- Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual review and signoff on all critical results, escalations, integrity signals, and improvement progress.
- End-of-week, end-of-month, end-of-quarter, and end-of-year synthesis and confirmation of system stabilization and improvement integration.
- Weekend, quarterly, and annual summary review and signoff on any critical events.
