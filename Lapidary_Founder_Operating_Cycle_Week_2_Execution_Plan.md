# Lapidary Founder Operating Cycle — Week 2 Execution Plan (L‑FOC‑W2)

---

## 1. Week 1 → Week 2 Transition

- **Synthesize Week 1 Outcomes**: Review platform, governance, evolution, ecosystem, and founder presence results.
- **Carry Forward Unresolved Deltas**: Integrate outstanding architecture, process, and decision deltas into Week 2 plans.
- **Escalate Issues to Monthly Cycle**: Flag major risks, drift, or unresolved issues for monthly review.
- **Reset Governance/Integrity/Evolution Surfaces**: Re-initialize all enforcement, audit, and evolution protocols for new week.
- **Establish Week 2 Operating Posture**: Set focus on reinforcement, refinement, and amplification.

---

## 2. Weekly Objectives (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Platform Stability Reinforcement**: Proactively monitor, patch, and validate all core services.
- **Governance Enforcement/Integrity Hardening**: Enforce policies, run deeper audits, address exceptions, update documentation.
- **Evolution Engine Refinement**: Tune evolution pipelines, recalibrate models, address drift triggers, update backlog.
- **Rockhound Ecosystem Progression**: Advance category language, value loops, community engagement, and product surfaces.
- **Founder Presence Amplification**: Increase communication frequency, deepen narrative, expand public engagement.

---

## 3. Daily Execution Rhythm

- **Day 1**: Synthesize Week 1, integrate deltas, update logs, set Week 2 priorities.
- **Day 2**: Enforce governance, refine policies, run integrity checks, log exceptions.
- **Day 3**: Scan for intelligence/model drift, trigger evolution tasks, update model registry.
- **Day 4**: Execute ecosystem growth/community tasks, launch new engagement surfaces.
- **Day 5**: Expand founder presence (micro-update, Q&A, narrative post), reinforce category stewardship.
- **Day 6**: Review telemetry, check predictive accuracy, extract insights, trigger evolution as needed.
- **Day 7**: Synthesize week, evaluate outcomes, refine processes, plan Week 3, escalate to monthly cycle.

---

## 4. Decision Log Continuation

- **Decisions to Log**: All platform, governance, evolution, ecosystem, and narrative decisions.
- **Quality Evaluation**: Review for clarity, rationale, impact, and auditability.
- **Continuity**: Cross-reference with Week 1; ensure decision threads are maintained.
- **Escalation**: Flag decisions for monthly/quarterly cycles as needed.

---

## 5. Architecture Delta Log Continuation

- **Deltas to Capture**: All architecture, model, and process changes; classify and log.
- **Drift Detection**: Apply drift detection rules; flag and address anomalies.
- **Integration**: Feed deltas into Week 3 planning and evolution backlog.
- **Cross-Cycle Propagation**: Ensure deltas are visible across weekly, monthly, and quarterly cycles.

---

## 6. Telemetry & Intelligence Review

- **Signals**: Monitor platform health, sync/queue status, model accuracy, user engagement, error rates.
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Checkpoints for model performance, user feedback, and correction rates.
- **Evolution Triggers**: Log triggers for recalibration, refactoring, or process improvement.
- **Ecosystem Intelligence**: Extract insights for product, community, and growth optimization.

---

## 7. Founder Presence Execution

- **Daily Micro-Updates**: Themes—build progress, insights, field learnings, community highlights, narrative anchors.
- **Weekly Letter**: Outline—progress, philosophy, roadmap deltas, category narrative, next steps.
- **Narrative Alignment**: Daily/weekly review for consistency with category pillars and mental model.
- **Category Stewardship**: Reinforce category language, respond to community, clarify vision.

---

## 8. End-of-Week Synthesis

- **Evaluate**: Platform stability, governance compliance, evolution progress, ecosystem activation, founder presence.
- **Refine**: Adjust processes, update templates, address gaps.
- **Carry Forward**: Outstanding actions, unresolved issues, new insights.
- **Escalate**: Major issues, drift, or risks to monthly strategic cycle for deeper review.
