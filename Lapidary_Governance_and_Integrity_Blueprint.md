## 1. Governance Architecture

- **Core Governance Loops**: Policy definition → enforcement (automated/manual) → audit (event logs, reviews) → refinement (policy updates, corrective action).
- **Deterministic Decision-Making Rules**: All governance decisions follow explicit, auditable rules; no ad hoc exceptions; rationale logged.
- **Cross-Product Governance Alignment**: Governance policies and enforcement consistent across Rockhound, future apps, and platform services; shared governance backlog.
- **Replay-Safe Governance Pipelines**: All governance actions/event logs are replayable, versioned, and auditable; rollback supported.
- **Drift Prevention/Correction**: Continuous monitoring for policy/architecture drift; automated flagging; deterministic correction protocols.

---

## 2. Integrity Engine (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Data Integrity Checks**: Schema validation, contract versioning, backward compatibility, automated data audits.
- **Intelligence Integrity**: Model drift detection, scoring audits, versioned model registry, golden dataset validation.
- **Autonomy Integrity**: Safe-action boundaries, override rules, user control surfaces, audit logs for all autonomous actions.
- **Sync Integrity**: Conflict resolution protocols, reconciliation guarantees, event log replay for all sync actions.
- **Telemetry Integrity**: Signal validation, anomaly detection, privacy filters, audit trails for all telemetry events.

---

## 3. Safety & Transparency Framework

- **Safety Boundaries**: Explicit boundaries for intelligence/autonomy; no black-box actions; user override always available.
- **Transparency Surfaces**: User-visible logs, decision explanations, policy documentation, public changelogs.
- **Auditability Requirements**: All actions/event logs are auditable, replayable, and versioned; audit trails accessible to authorized users.
- **Privacy/Data Stewardship**: Strict privacy controls, data minimization, user consent, long-term stewardship commitments.
- **Failure Mode Containment/Recovery**: All failures contained, logged, and recoverable; rollback and user notification protocols.

---

## 4. Cross‑Subsystem Governance Surfaces

- **FieldSession**: Policy enforcement on session creation, data capture, telemetry feedback.
- **CaptureSession**: Preprocessing/classification rules enforced; integrity checks on all automated actions.
- **FindLog**: Enrichment/scoring rules; audit trails for all enrichments and scoring events.
- **Collection**: Categorization rules; consistency checks; long-term data integrity audits.
- **Dashboard**: Insight validation; anomaly detection; user-facing audit logs for all surfaced insights.

---

## 5. Long‑Horizon Alignment

- **1/3/10 Year Governance Direction**: Governance vision and policies reviewed and updated on 1, 3, and 10-year horizons; roadmap aligned.
- **Category Alignment/Narrative Consistency**: Governance supports and reinforces category leadership and narrative clarity.
- **Founder Oversight/Escalation**: Founder reviews all major governance changes; clear escalation paths for critical issues.
- **Ecosystem Gravity Safeguards**: Governance ensures platform remains the gravitational center; prevents fragmentation/drift.
- **Evolution Boundaries/Non-Negotiables**: Explicit boundaries for evolution; core principles and user rights non-negotiable.

## 6. Architecture Diagrams (Text-Described)

- **Governance Loop**: Policy → enforcement → audit → refinement → next policy.
- **Integrity Engine Map**: Data, intelligence, autonomy, sync, telemetry integrity checks feeding into a unified audit/logging layer.
- **Cross-Product Governance Graph**: Governance nodes for each product/service; shared policy and audit layers; bidirectional feedback.
- **Drift Detection/Correction Flow**: Continuous monitoring → drift flag → correction protocol → audit log.
- **Transparency/Auditability Layering**: User/system actions → event logs → audit trails → user/owner review.

---

## 7. Implementation Blueprint

- **Quarterly Governance Cycle**: Scheduled reviews, audits, policy updates, and roadmap alignment.
- **Annual Integrity Audit**: Deep-dive audits of data, intelligence, autonomy, sync, and telemetry integrity.
- **Governance Backlog Structure**: Prioritized, versioned, cross-product; includes policy, audit, and integrity items.
- **Metrics/KPIs**: Policy compliance, audit log coverage, drift incidents, user override rates, privacy incidents.
- **Risk Matrix/Mitigation**: Governance risks identified, mitigations planned, owners assigned, status tracked.
