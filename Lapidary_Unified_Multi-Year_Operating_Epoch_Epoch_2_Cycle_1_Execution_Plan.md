# Lapidary Unified Multi‑Year Operating Epoch — Epoch 2, Cycle 1 Execution Plan (L‑UMYOEP‑E2C1)

## Purpose

Deterministically execute the first full cycle of the second 5-year epoch, operationalizing all inter-epoch and next-generation systems in a unified, oversight-driven rhythm.

## 1. Inter‑Epoch Governance Actions

- **Board Inauguration:** Convene new epoch governance board; confirm roles, escalation protocols, and synthesis cadence.
- **Legacy Protocol Integration:** Review and integrate legacy governance protocols and decision logs from Epoch 1.
- **Escalation Pathways:** Activate multi-layer escalation and audit log routing; ensure all events are board-visible.

## 2. Next‑Generation Evolution‑Engine Execution

- **Engine Launch:** Deploy next-generation evolution engine; activate initial blueprint, system, and self-improvement triggers.
- **Quarterly Evolution Sprint:** Schedule and begin first evolution sprint; log all changes and escalate major shifts.
- **Annual Evolution Synthesis Prep:** Set parameters and schedule for first annual evolution synthesis.

## 3. Expanded Ecosystem‑Federation Progression

- **Federation Phase 1 Expansion:** Initiate first phase of expanded ecosystem federation; activate new partnership and integration triggers.
- **Milestone Tracking:** Begin automated tracking of federation maturity milestones; escalate blockers.
- **Federation Synthesis:** Schedule first quarterly federation synthesis and recalibration.

## 4. Escalated Category‑Leadership Arcs

- **Category Arc Escalation:** Launch escalated category expansion and language propagation tasks.
- **Expansion Milestone Tracking:** Automate tracking and escalation of category expansion events.
- **Category Synthesis:** Schedule first quarterly category synthesis and recalibration.

## 5. Architectural Founder‑Presence Deployment

- **Presence Architecture Launch:** Deploy founder presence as an architectural, self-sustaining system.
- **Presence Delegation:** Begin delegation and propagation of presence/narrative at scale.
- **Founder Synthesis:** Schedule first quarterly founder synthesis and recalibration.

## 6. Ecosystem‑Wide Telemetry Oversight

- **Unified Telemetry Boot:** Activate ecosystem-wide telemetry ingestion and analysis for all domains.
- **Oversight Dashboard Monitoring:** Board and founder review real-time signals, escalations, and trends.
- **Synthesis-Driven Actions:** Trigger oversight actions based on telemetry at all synthesis layers.

## 7. Expansive Drift‑Prevention Enforcement

- **Drift Engine Expansion:** Enforce drift-prevention in expansive mode; focus on system growth and resilience.
- **Hardening Sprint Launch:** Begin first quarterly hardening sprint for drift detection and correction.
- **Drift Event Routing:** Ensure all drift events are auto-escalated and resolved at the correct synthesis layer.

## 8. Subordinate Cycle Synchronization

- **Cycle Sync Engine:** Programmatically synchronize all weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual cycles to the Epoch-2 rhythm.
- **Synthesis Layer Execution:** Automate scheduling and execution of all subordinate syntheses; escalate blockers.
- **Founder/Board Oversight:** Ensure all cycles, syntheses, and escalations are visible and actionable by founder and board.

**This L‑UMYOEP‑E2C1 plan ensures deterministic, unified execution of the first cycle of the second 5-year epoch, integrating all governance, evolution, ecosystem, category, founder, and oversight actions into a single Epoch-2-aligned operating rhythm.**
