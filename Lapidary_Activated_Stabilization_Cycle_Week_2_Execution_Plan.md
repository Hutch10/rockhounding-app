# Lapidary Activated Stabilization Cycle — Week 2 Execution Plan (L‑ASC‑W2)

## Purpose

Deterministically execute the second full week of the activated post‑sweep stabilization cycle, integrating structural improvements and maintaining all lock‑in, drift‑prevention, and oversight mechanisms.

## Daily Execution Plan

### Day 1 (Monday)

- **CI Drift/Integrity Check:** Run automated CI checks for terminology, schema, template, and cross‑reference drift.
- **Audit Log Aggregation:** Collect and centralize all audit, decision, and delta logs from prior week.
- **Structural Improvement Review:** Identify and prioritize structural improvements for integration this week.
- **Founder Oversight:** Founder reviews CI, audit log, and improvement priorities; signs off on initial state.

### Day 2 (Tuesday)

- **Blueprint/Activation Sync:** Scripted validation of all activation plans against blueprints; auto‑escalate mismatches.
- **Template Usage Audit:** Check all logs/cycles for canonical template compliance; flag deviations.
- **Structural Improvement Integration:** Begin implementation of top-priority structural improvements.
- **Telemetry Ingestion:** Ingest system health, drift, and escalation signals.
- **Founder Oversight:** Founder reviews blueprint/activation sync, template audit, and improvement progress.

### Day 3 (Wednesday)

- **Drift‑Prevention Trigger Test:** Simulate drift event; verify auto‑escalation and correction workflow.
- **Governance/Evolution Sync:** Run scheduled reconciliation script; confirm alignment.
- **Structural Improvement Integration:** Continue/complete implementation of improvements.
- **Audit Log Review:** Review and resolve any escalations from drift-prevention triggers.
- **Founder Oversight:** Founder signs off on drift-prevention, governance/evolution sync, and improvement status.

### Day 4 (Thursday)

- **Integrity Score Update:** Auto‑recalculate system integrity score; review for drops or anomalies.
- **Public Narrative Sync:** Update public docs/narrative to reflect current stabilization and improvement state.
- **Telemetry Review:** Analyze trend of drift, escalation, and integrity signals.
- **Founder Oversight:** Founder reviews integrity score, telemetry trends, and improvement impact.

### Day 5 (Friday)

- **Weekly Audit Log Synthesis:** Aggregate and synthesize all audit, decision, and delta logs for the week.
- **Final Drift/Template Audit:** Run end-of-week CI checks for drift and template compliance.
- **Governance/Evolution Confirmation:** Confirm all cycles and blueprints remain in sync.
- **Structural Improvement Review:** Evaluate effectiveness of integrated improvements; document outcomes.
- **Founder Oversight:** Founder reviews and signs off on weekly synthesis, drift/template audit, governance/evolution confirmation, and improvement outcomes.

## Automation & Verification

- All checks and audits are CI‑triggered and block merges on failure.
- Drift events auto‑escalate to audit log and founder dashboard.
- All logs use canonical templates; deviations trigger correction tasks.
- Telemetry signals ingested daily and reviewed by founder.
- Governance/evolution sync and escalation pathways confirmed midweek and end-of-week.
- Structural improvements tracked and verified for impact.

## Founder‑Level Oversight Actions

- Daily review and signoff on all critical results, escalations, integrity signals, and improvement progress.
- End-of-week synthesis and confirmation of system stabilization and improvement integration.

**This L‑ASC‑W2 plan ensures deterministic, founder‑supervised execution and continuous improvement during the second week of Lapidary’s activated stabilization cycle.**
