# Lapidary Founder Operating Cycle — Month 3 Activation Plan (L‑FOC‑M3)

---

## 1. Month 2 → Month 3 Transition

- **Synthesize Month 2 Outcomes**: Review platform, governance, evolution, ecosystem, and founder presence results.
- **Integrate Cross-Week Deltas**: Aggregate and resolve all outstanding architecture, process, and decision deltas from Weeks 5–8.
- **Escalate Unresolved Issues**: Flag major risks, drift, or unresolved issues for quarterly review.
- **Reset Governance/Integrity/Evolution Surfaces**: Re-initialize enforcement, audit, and evolution protocols for new month.
- **Establish Month 3 Operating Posture**: Focus on consolidation, automation, scaling, and leadership.

---

## 2. Monthly Objectives (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Platform Stability Consolidation**: Validate all core services; address regressions; ensure no critical errors.
- **Governance Automation/Integrity Reinforcement**: Automate policy enforcement, run audits, address exceptions, update documentation.
- **Evolution Engine Expansion/Predictive Refinement**: Expand evolution pipelines, recalibrate models, refine predictive accuracy, update backlog.
- **Rockhound Ecosystem Scaling/Community Growth**: Scale category language, value loops, community engagement, and product surfaces.
- **Founder Presence Amplification/Category Leadership**: Increase communication, deepen narrative, reinforce category leadership, expand public engagement.

---

## 3. Monthly Audit Cycle

- **Platform Integrity Audit**: Validate determinism, replay safety, auditability; run chaos/edge tests; review event logs.
- **Documentation Delta Consolidation**: Merge doc changes, update onboarding/architecture docs, publish deltas.
- **Ecosystem Intelligence Review**: Analyze behavioral trends, predictive accuracy, model drift; update models as needed.
- **Category Alignment/Narrative Drift Scan**: Ensure narrative, product, and ecosystem remain aligned with category vision; scan for drift.
- **Infrastructure Scaling Checkpoint**: Review storage, telemetry, sync queues; plan scaling and optimization.
- **Founder Presence Refinement**: Review and refine public presence, voice, and leadership rituals.

---

## 4. Evolution Engine Expansion

- **Predictive Accuracy Improvement**: Schedule tasks for model improvement, feature engineering, and validation.
- **Model Recalibration/Scoring Refinement**: Continuous recalibration, scoring, and validation; update model registry.
- **User Correction Ingestion/Pattern Extraction**: Ingest, log, and analyze user corrections for model impact and pattern discovery.
- **Offline-First Intelligence Evolution**: All evolution steps support offline-first operation; queued for sync and replay.
- **Safety/Transparency Boundaries**: All changes logged, user-visible; no black-box evolution; user override and auditability enforced.

---

## 5. Governance & Integrity Reinforcement

- **Policy Enforcement Automation**: Automate compliance checks, exception handling, and reporting.
- **Integrity Checklist Execution**: Run standardized checklists for all enforcement surfaces and subsystems.
- **Drift Detection/Correction**: Apply drift detection rules; flag and address anomalies.
- **Audit Logging/Replay Validation**: Ensure all actions/event logs are auditable, replayable, and versioned.
- **Cross-Product Governance Alignment**: Align governance and integrity audits across Rockhound, future apps, and platform services.

---

## 6. Ecosystem Growth Activation

- **Gravity Engine Scaling**: Expand capture → insight → action → mastery loops; reinforce with feedback and progression.
- **Community Scaffolding Expansion**: Launch new community features, empower leaders, expand events.
- **Viral Surface Optimization**: Enhance sharing, hotspots, specimen stories; integrate social tools.
- **Retention Loop Refinement**: Deploy progression, mastery, and insight features; nudge users to return and progress.
- **Telemetry-Driven Growth Insights**: Monitor activation, retention, and virality; iterate on growth levers using telemetry insights.

---

## 7. Founder Presence Expansion

- **Monthly Narrative Anchor**: Publish category-shaping essay or story.
- **Founder Letter Outline**: Progress, philosophy, roadmap deltas, category narrative, next steps.
- **Category Stewardship Actions**: Reinforce category language, respond to community, clarify vision.
- **Communication Cadence Refinement**: Adjust frequency, format, and channels based on feedback.
- **Narrative Drift Prevention**: Anchor all narrative evolution to core pillars; review and refine regularly.

---

## 8. End-of-Month Synthesis

- **Evaluate**: Platform stability, governance compliance, evolution progress, ecosystem activation, founder presence.
- **Refine**: Adjust processes, update templates, address gaps.
- **Carry Forward**: Outstanding actions, unresolved issues, new insights.
- **Escalate**: Major issues, drift, or risks to quarterly strategic cycle for deeper review.
- **Prepare for Month 4 Activation**: Review objectives, align team, update roadmap, set vision for next cycle.
