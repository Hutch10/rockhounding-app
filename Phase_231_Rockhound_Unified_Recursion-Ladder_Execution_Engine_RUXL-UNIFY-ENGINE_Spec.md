# Phase 231 — Rockhound Unified Recursion-Ladder Execution Engine (RUXL-UNIFY-ENGINE)

## Deterministic, Regeneration-Safe Unified Recursion-Ladder Execution Specification

---

### 1. Architecture

- **Execution Model:** Canon-governed, deterministic state machine for all unified recursion-ladder transitions; all steps versioned and auditable.
- **Cross-Era↔Cross-Epoch↔Cross-Hyper-Epoch Propagation:** Explicit, versioned propagation rules ensure seamless state transfer and integrity across all recursion ladders; no orphaned or partial transitions.
- **Global Invariants/Meta-Stability Constraints:** All global invariants and meta-stability constraints enforced at every recursion scale; changes are versioned, auditable, and rollback-capable.
- **Dependency Graph/Sequencing:** Explicit, versioned dependency graph; deterministic sequencing logic for all recursion ladders.

---

### 2. Engine / Execution Layer

- **Unified Recursion-Boundary Detection/Classification:** Deterministic detection and classification of recursion boundaries; all transitions classified by scope and impact.
- **Transition Sequencing/Triggers:** All transitions follow deterministic, rollback- and fallback-capable sequences; triggers are canon-governed and auditable.
- **ENG↔CANON↔INTEL Sync:** Synchronization across all engines and recursion scales; all state changes validated and versioned.
- **Safe Propagation:** Intelligence, canon, and engineering updates propagate safely and deterministically across all ladders; rollback on failure.

---

### 3. Stability & Safety

- **Drift Detection/Correction:** Automated, deterministic drift detection and correction at every recursion ladder boundary and within ladders.
- **Invariant Enforcement:** UX, UI, data, and intelligence invariants enforced at global recursion scale; no drift or unvalidated transitions.
- **Degraded-Mode:** Deterministic degraded-mode behavior for all cross-ladder transitions; all actions rollback-capable.
- **Regeneration/Rollback:** All regeneration and rollback logic is deterministic, versioned, and auditable for unified recursion execution.

---

### 4. Performance & Reliability

- **Latency/Throughput:** ≤5s multi-ladder transition latency; ≥99.999% successful transitions; resource usage bounded by device class and recursion context.
- **Multi-Device/Offline-First/Field-Mode:** All logic operates offline-first and field-mode aware; syncs and validations occur when connectivity resumes.
- **Long-Horizon Optimization:** Scheduled, deterministic optimization cycles across recursion lifecycles; performance baselines enforced.

---

### 5. Observability & Oversight

- **Telemetry Schema:** Real-time, versioned telemetry for all unified recursion executions; all events and anomalies logged.
- **Dashboards/Alerts:** Founder-grade dashboards; canon-governed alerts and anomaly detection at global recursion scale.
- **Oversight Rhythm:** Founder oversight integrated into all recursion-aware executions; all actions auditable and reviewable.

---

### 6. Output Requirements

- Ultra-dense, deterministic, single-pass, regeneration-safe
- Canonical JSON + human-readable spec
- No filler, no drift
