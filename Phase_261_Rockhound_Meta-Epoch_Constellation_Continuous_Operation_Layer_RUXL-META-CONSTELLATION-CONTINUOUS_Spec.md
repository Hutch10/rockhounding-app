## Human-Readable: Meta-Epoch Constellation Continuous Operation Layer (Ultra-Dense, Parallel Micro-Phases)

### A. Layer Definition & Scope

- Purpose: maintain global stability, enforce constellation invariants, orchestrate long-horizon evolution, ensure perpetual drift-free operation
- Boundaries: no product features, only meta-operational runtime

### B. Global Constellation Scheduler

- Scheduling: build, release, field-test, evolution cycles, meta-epoch transitions
- Acceptance: all cycles operate without contention/starvation

### C. Cross-Engine Synchronization

- Synchronize: implementation, field-test, evolution, release engines
- Acceptance: all engines share coherent global state at all times

### D. Constellation Invariant Enforcement

- Invariants: determinism, regeneration safety, compatibility, cross-device continuity, long-horizon evolution
- Acceptance: invariants hold across all epochs/cycles

### E. Meta-Epoch Transition Logic

- Rules: enter new meta-epoch, stabilize transitions, retain long-horizon state
- Acceptance: transitions occur without drift/regression

### F. Failure Containment & Global Recovery

- Rules: cross-engine failure detection, cascade prevention, global rollback, deterministic recovery
- Acceptance: no failure destabilizes the constellation

### G. Long-Horizon Evolution Engine

- Rules: multi-epoch evolution, telemetry aggregation, constellation-scale optimization, cross-version continuity
- Acceptance: Rockhound evolves safely across epochs/meta-epochs

### H. Canonical JSON Continuous Operation Schema

- Output: full continuous-operation layer as canonical JSON (engines, cycles, invariants, transitions, recovery, evolution)
