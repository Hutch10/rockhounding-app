# Phase 213 — Rockhound Unified Activation & Expansion Blueprint (RUXL-UNIFY)

## Deterministic, Regeneration-Safe Unified Activation & Expansion Specification

---

### 1. Engineering Implementation Activation

- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with apps (mobile, desktop, web), packages (shared, components, data, intelligence), scripts, and docs.
- **Codebase Initialization:** Deterministic setup scripts; versioned, reproducible environments.
- **Component Integration Sequencing:** RUXL-COMP components integrated by priority (core UI, map, overlays, alerts, catalog, profile).
- **Navigation/Data-Layer Wiring:** RUXL-NAV navigation and RUXL-XDEV data layer wired first; offline-first logic enforced.
- **Build Pipeline Activation:** CI/CD for all platforms; deterministic build artifacts; cross-device test matrix.
- **Sprint Cadence/Checkpoints:** 2-week sprints; integration checkpoints at each feature milestone; deterministic review gates.

---

### 2. Canon Consolidation & Governance

- **Phase Consolidation:** Merge Phases 200–212 into a single, versioned canonical structure; all specs cross-linked and archived.
- **Update/Versioning Rules:** Semantic versioning for all specs; deterministic update and rollback policies.
- **Governance Model:** Founder-led, audit-trail-enforced governance; all changes reviewed and logged.
- **Oversight/Auditability:** Immutable audit logs; deterministic regeneration for all canon changes.

---

### 3. Intelligence Loop Expansion

- **Scoring Model Expansion:** Multi-layer, explainable, versioned scoring models; deterministic input/output.
- **Geological Inference:** Integration of geological, mineralogical, and environmental data; explainable inference logic.
- **Seasonal/Environmental Intelligence:** Dynamic overlays and advisories; deterministic update hooks.
- **Confidence/Uncertainty Modeling:** Enhanced rationale, confidence, and uncertainty surfaces; deterministic fallback logic.
- **Versioning/Safety Rails:** All intelligence logic versioned, rollback-capable, and bounded by safety rails.

---

### 4. Cross-Track Integration

- **Unified Evolution:** Engineering, canon, and intelligence evolve in lockstep; all dependencies mapped and sequenced.
- **Dependency Mapping:** Deterministic mapping of component, data, and intelligence dependencies.
- **Multi-Device Consistency:** All intelligence outputs consistent across devices; field-mode and offline-first guarantees enforced.
- **Field-Mode Intelligence:** Intelligence overlays, alerts, and advisories optimized for field-mode constraints.
- **Offline-First Guarantees:** All intelligence and data flows support offline capture, queueing, and sync.

---

### 5. Long-Horizon Activation Plan

- **Multi-Quarter Roadmap:** Deterministic, versioned roadmap with parallelizable workstreams (engineering, intelligence, canon).
- **Parallel Workstreams:** UI/UX, data, intelligence, and field-mode teams work in parallel; shared integration checkpoints.
- **Release Gating/Validation:** All releases gated by cross-device, field-mode, and intelligence validation.
- **Observability/Telemetry:** Real-time, cross-track dashboards; deterministic event tracing and anomaly detection.
- **Founder Oversight Rhythm:** Scheduled review cycles, audit logs, and founder-grade governance.

---

### 6. Output Requirements

- Ultra-dense, deterministic, single-pass, regeneration-safe
- Canonical JSON + human-readable spec
- No filler, no drift
