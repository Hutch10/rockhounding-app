## 1. Evolution Engine Architecture

- **Deterministic Evolution Loops**: Signal (telemetry, feedback, drift) → evaluation (metrics, audits) → refinement (design, retrain, refactor) → deployment (controlled, replay-safe).
- **Drift Detection/Correction Rules**: Continuous monitoring for model, architecture, and ecosystem drift; automated flagging; deterministic correction protocols.
- **Replay-Safe Evolution Pipelines**: All evolution steps logged, versioned, and replayable; rollback and auditability guaranteed.
- **Cross-Product Evolution Alignment**: Evolution signals and refinements propagate across Rockhound, future apps, and platform services; shared evolution backlog.
- **Telemetry-Driven Prioritization**: Telemetry and user feedback drive evolution priorities; high-impact issues surfaced automatically.

---

## 2. Intelligence Evolution (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Model Recalibration**: Regular scoring, heuristic tuning, feature reweighting; golden dataset validation; versioned model registry.
- **Behavioral Trend Analysis**: Continuous review of user and ecosystem trends; predictive accuracy tracked; anomalies flagged.
- **Feedback Loop Ingestion**: User corrections and feedback ingested; model updates scheduled; feedback impact measured.
- **Offline-First Evolution Guarantees**: All intelligence evolution steps support offline-first operation; queued for sync and replay.
- **Safety/Transparency Boundaries**: All changes logged, user-visible; no black-box evolution; user override and auditability enforced.

---

## 3. Architecture Evolution

- **Determinism Audits**: Regular audits for deterministic behavior; event log replay tests; non-determinism flagged and corrected.
- **Sync/Offline Engine Evolution**: Evolution rules for sync/queue logic; backward compatibility; performance regression checks.
- **Data Contract Evolution**: Versioned schemas; compatibility layers; replay safety for all contract changes.
- **Performance/Scaling Evolution**: Storage, queue, and telemetry scaling plans; stress/chaos testing; regression prevention.
- **Hardening/Regression Prevention**: Automated regression tests; chaos/failure injection; hardening backlog.

---

## 4. Ecosystem Evolution

- **Category Evolution**: Narrative, positioning, and mental model reviewed and evolved; category leadership maintained.
- **Gravity Amplification**: Mechanisms to increase ecosystem stickiness; network effect optimization; community engagement.
- **Community/Network Effect Evolution**: Community scaffolding, leaderboards, events; feedback loops for community-driven evolution.
- **Cross-Device Continuity Evolution**: Seamless experience across devices; continuity audits; sync/merge improvements.
- **Long-Horizon Direction**: 1, 3, 10-year vision reviews; roadmap updates; ecosystem health metrics.

---

## 5. Founder Evolution Surfaces

- **Founder Presence Evolution**: Regular review and refinement of public presence, voice, and leadership rituals.
- **Leadership Rhythm Evolution**: Cadence of reviews, updates, and rituals adjusted for platform maturity and scale.
- **Communication Cadence Refinement**: Feedback-driven refinement of communication frequency, format, and channels.
- **Decision-Making Auditability**: All major decisions logged, rationale documented, audit trails maintained.
- **Narrative Stewardship**: Founder ensures narrative clarity, category leadership, and vision continuity over time.

## 6. Architecture Diagrams (Text-Described)

- **Evolution Engine Loop**: Signal → evaluation → refinement → deployment → feedback → next signal.
- **Drift Detection/Correction Map**: Telemetry/metrics → drift flag → correction protocol → audit log.
- **Cross-Product Evolution Graph**: Rockhound/future apps/platform services nodes; evolution signals/changes propagate bidirectionally.
- **Intelligence Evolution Pipeline**: Data/feedback → model scoring → recalibration → deployment → monitoring.
- **Ecosystem Evolution Flywheel**: Community/usage → intelligence/category evolution → platform improvement → increased gravity → repeat.

---

## 7. Implementation Blueprint

- **Quarterly Evolution Cycle**: Scheduled reviews, audits, recalibrations, and roadmap updates.
- **Annual Platform Recalibration**: Deep-dive audits, model retraining, architecture refactoring, vision refresh.
- **Evolution Backlog Structure**: Prioritized, versioned, cross-product; includes architecture, intelligence, ecosystem, and founder items.
- **Metrics/KPIs**: Drift incidents, regression rates, model accuracy, ecosystem growth, user feedback impact.
- **Risk Matrix/Mitigation**: Evolution risks identified, mitigations planned, owners assigned, status tracked.
