## Human-Readable: Public Demo Finalization & Live Demo Readiness Cycle (Ultra-Dense)

- Scope: Finalize public demo for live presentation (UI polish, demo data, device test, timing/choreography, founder script, fallback, packaging, deck, landing)

### UI Polish

- Final navigation/layout/visuals
- Accessibility/contrast checks
- Consistent branding/iconography

### Demo Data

- Inject final specimens/collections/sessions
- Validate flows/edge cases

### Device Test

- Full pass on device matrix (mobile/desktop/OS)
- Document issues/workarounds

### Timing & Choreography

- Scripted timing for each flow
- Choreograph device/screen transitions
- Practice live handoff/sync

### Founder Script

- Final rehearsal script with timing/fallbacks
- Integrated with deck/live walkthrough

### Failure-Mode Fallback

- Predefined fallback for each segment
- Quick data reset/recovery
- Contingency for device/sync failures

### Packaging

- Final signed builds for all platforms
- Installer/TestFlight/sideload packages

### Deck Polish

- Final visuals/copy
- Sync with live demo script/flows

### Landing Page

- Final copy/visuals/CTA
- Validate downloads/contact

### Acceptance Criteria

- UI polished/access on all devices
- Demo data injected/validated
- All devices pass test matrix
- Demo timing/choreography rehearsed
- Founder script complete/rehearsed
- Fallbacks tested/ready
- Packaging ready
- Deck/landing finalized/in sync
