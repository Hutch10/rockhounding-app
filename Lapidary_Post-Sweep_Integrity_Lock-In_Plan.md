# Lapidary Post‑Sweep Integrity Lock‑In Plan (L‑PSILP)

## 1. Integrity Lock‑In Rules

- **Canonical Source Enforcement:** All operational, governance, evolution, and ecosystem blueprints must reference a single, versioned canonical source. No edits outside blueprint/activation files.
- **Glossary Hard‑Linking:** All key terms must be cross‑linked to the canonical glossary. No unlinked terminology allowed in blueprints, code, or public docs.
- **Schema/Template Immutability:** All schemas, audit/decision/delta log templates, and cycle checklists are immutable except via formal governance process.
- **Escalation Pathways:** All detected drift, error, or ambiguity must be escalated via the audit log and resolved within the next operating cycle.
- **Founder Presence Ritualization:** Founder presence and narrative routines are locked to the cadence and templates defined in the Founder Presence Blueprint.

## 2. Drift‑Prevention Activation

- **Automated Drift Detection:** CI pipeline runs automated checks for terminology drift, schema misalignment, missing cross‑references, and template usage on every commit.
- **Audit Log Centralization:** All audit, decision, and delta logs are centralized and versioned. No local or ad hoc logs permitted.
- **Blueprint/Activation Sync:** All activation plans must be programmatically checked for alignment with their blueprints. Mismatches block release.
- **Governance Watchdog:** Governance and integrity blueprints are monitored for unauthorized edits; all changes require multi‑signoff.

## 3. Structural Improvement Sequencing

1. **Canon Re‑Indexing:** Re‑index all blueprints, activation plans, and templates. Update all cross‑references and glossary links.
2. **Template Enforcement:** Enforce usage of canonical templates for all logs, cycles, and escalation events.
3. **CI Integration:** Integrate all drift/error checks into CI. Block merges on failure.
4. **Governance/Evolution Sync:** Reconcile governance and evolution blueprints for cycle, escalation, and audit alignment.
5. **Public Narrative Update:** Update public launch/narrative docs to reflect post‑sweep state and lock‑in rules.

## 4. Canon Re‑Indexing

- **Re‑index all canonical blueprints, activation plans, and templates.**
- **Update all internal and public cross‑references.**
- **Synchronize glossary and category language across all surfaces.**
- **Publish updated canon index and glossary.**

## 5. Updated Governance/Evolution Alignment

- **Cycle Alignment:** All governance and evolution cycles are synchronized for escalation, audit, and synthesis events.
- **Audit/Decision/Delta Log Unification:** All logs use the same canonical template and escalation path.
- **Integrity Score Recalibration:** Recalculate and publish system integrity score post‑lock‑in.
- **Continuous Evolution:** All future blueprint or template changes require governance review and drift‑prevention check before activation.

**This L‑PSILP is the deterministic lock‑in mechanism for Lapidary’s post‑sweep state. All future changes must comply with these rules and activation steps.**
