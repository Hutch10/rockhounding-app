## 1. Launch Positioning & Narrative

- **Core Story**: Problem (fragmented, analog fieldwork) → Transformation (seamless, intelligent, autonomous field platform) → New Category (field intelligence).
- **Founder Narrative**: Origin (personal field pain points) → Mission (empower discovery, mastery, and stewardship) → Long-Term Vision (global field intelligence network).
- **Category Language/Messaging Pillars**: FieldSession, FindLog, Specimen Graph, Mastery, Autonomy, Determinism, Continuity.
- **Differentiation**: Deterministic, auditable platform; proactive autonomy; actionable field intelligence; privacy-first, user-controllable.

---

## 2. Pre‑Launch Preparation (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Final Hardening Checklist**: Product (E2E tests, chaos, accessibility), Infra (scaling, failover), Sync (latency, error handling), Telemetry (coverage, privacy).
- **Documentation Consolidation**: All user/dev docs reviewed, merged, and published; onboarding and troubleshooting guides finalized.
- **Onboarding Polish/Activation Funnel**: First-run flows tested, drop-off points addressed, tooltips and walkthroughs refined.
- **Beta Cohort Selection/Seeding**: Identify and invite diverse early users; seed with field leaders and advocates.
- **Community Scaffolding**: Launch Discord, field challenges, leaderboards; empower early leaders as moderators.

---

## 3. Launch Execution Plan

- **Announcement Strategy**: Multi-channel (email, social, community, press); sequenced (teaser → launch → follow-up); timed for max impact.
- **Demo Scripts/Walkthroughs**: Polished, repeatable demos; guided field scenarios; live and recorded options.
- **Content Plan**: Launch videos, specimen stories, field guides, docs; press kit with logos, screenshots, founder bio.
- **Visual Identity Alignment**: Consistent branding across all assets; press kit ready.
- **Founder Communication Cadence**: Daily (launch week), weekly (first 90 days), monthly (ongoing); transparent, authentic updates.

---

## 4. Growth Engine Activation

- **Viral Surfaces**: Shareable finds, hotspots, specimen stories; built-in sharing tools.
- **Retention Loops**: Progression, mastery, personalized insights; regular nudges and milestones.
- **Community Loops**: Local groups, leaderboards, field events; foster belonging and competition.
- **Telemetry-Driven Optimization**: Monitor activation, retention, mastery; iterate on funnel and features.

---

## 5. Reliability, Trust & Safety Guarantees

- **Deterministic Behavior**: All user/system actions deterministic, auditable, and replayable.
- **Transparent Autonomy/Override**: All autonomous actions visible, user-overridable, and logged.
- **Privacy/Data Stewardship**: Strict privacy controls, user data never shared without consent, long-term stewardship.
- **Auditability**: All insights, recommendations, and actions logged for user review.

---

## 6. Architecture Diagrams (Text-Described)

- **Launch Funnel Map**: Awareness → onboarding → activation → retention → mastery; telemetry at each stage.
- **Growth Engine Activation Loop**: User action → share/insight → community engagement → new user acquisition → repeat.
- **Community Scaffolding Diagram**: Discord, field challenges, leaderboards, early leaders; feedback and moderation loops.
- **Founder Communication Cycle**: Announcement → feedback → update → roadmap delta → next announcement.

---

## 7. Implementation Blueprint

- **30-Day Pre-Launch Plan**: Finalize hardening, docs, onboarding, beta seeding, community setup.
- **7-Day Launch Sprint**: Execute announcements, demos, content drops, founder comms, monitor metrics.
- **90-Day Post-Launch Evolution**: Weekly/biweekly updates, rapid iteration, community engagement, growth optimization.
- **Metrics/KPIs**: Activation rate, retention, DAU/MAU, share rate, community growth, support tickets, audit log events.
- **Risk Matrix/Mitigation**: Launch delays (buffer, comms), infra failures (failover, monitoring), negative feedback (rapid response), privacy incidents (audit, rollback).

**This FLB ensures a deterministic, high-impact, and trust-centered transition from internal development to public launch, maximizing user activation, retention, and category leadership.**
