## Human-Readable: Meta-Epoch Constellation Hyper-Evolution Layer (Ultra-Dense, Parallel Micro-Phases)

### A. Layer Definition & Scope

- Purpose: govern evolution across meta-epoch constellations, maintain cross-constellation continuity, preserve invariants across generations, coordinate long-horizon transformation
- Boundaries: no product features, only hyper-evolution logic

### B. Hyper-Epoch Signal Aggregation Engine

- Rules: aggregate telemetry across meta-epochs, detect long-horizon transformation signals, correlate cross-constellation patterns
- Acceptance: hyper-epoch signals are stable, reproducible, drift-free

### C. Multi-Constellation Evolution Pipeline

- Stages: hyper-signal detection, proposal, cross-constellation validation, scheduling, execution, stabilization
- Acceptance: evolution flows operate across constellations without drift

### D. Cross-Constellation Compatibility & Continuity

- Rules: schema, protocol, engine, UX evolution across constellations
- Acceptance: continuity preserved across generational boundaries

### E. Hyper-Epoch Invariant Enforcement

- Invariants: determinism, regeneration safety, cross-constellation compatibility, long-horizon stability, perpetual evolution
- Acceptance: invariants hold across all constellations

### F. Hyper-Epoch Recovery & Containment

- Rules: detect regressions, rollback cross-constellation changes, stabilize post-hyper-evolution
- Acceptance: hyper-evolution never destabilizes the system

### G. Hyper-Epoch Scheduling Engine

- Rules: constellation-level evolution, meta-epoch, hyper-epoch transitions
- Acceptance: scheduling conflict-free across all horizons

### H. Canonical JSON Hyper-Evolution Schema

- Output: full hyper-evolution layer as canonical JSON (engines, pipelines, invariants, transitions, recovery, telemetry)
