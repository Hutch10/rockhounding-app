## 1. Founder Weekly Operating Cycle

- **Priority-Setting Framework**: Inputs (telemetry, user feedback, roadmap, metrics) → Decisions (prioritize, defer, escalate) → Commitments (weekly OKRs, sprint goals, release targets).
- **Execution Loops**: Build (feature/dev work) → Validate (test, user feedback, metrics) → Integrate (merge, deploy, document) → Harden (fix, refactor, automate).
- **Communication Cadences**: Internal notes (weekly summary, blockers, wins), release updates (changelog, new features), roadmap deltas (public/private, highlight shifts).
- **Metrics Review**: Usage (DAU/MAU, retention), sync health (latency, error rates), pipeline performance (throughput, accuracy), autonomy accuracy (suggestion acceptance, override rates).
- **Drift Detection/Correction**: Weekly review of metrics vs. targets; flag drift; corrective action logged and assigned.

---

## 2. Monthly Strategic Cycle (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Subsystem Health Audits**: Review FieldSession, FindLog, CaptureSession, Pipeline, Sync, Telemetry for uptime, error rates, regressions.
- **Architecture Integrity Checks**: Validate determinism, replay safety, offline guarantees; run chaos tests; review event logs.
- **Ecosystem Intelligence Review**: Analyze behavioral trends, predictive accuracy, model drift; update intelligence models as needed.
- **Documentation Deltas/Consolidation**: Audit doc changes, consolidate, update onboarding and architecture docs.
- **Release Readiness Checkpoints**: Review open issues, test coverage, migration/rollback plans, go/no-go for next release.

---

## 3. Quarterly Evolution Cycle

- **Platform Direction Review**: Assess ecosystem gravity, network effects, category creation; adjust vision and roadmap.
- **Intelligence Model Recalibration**: Re-score, tune heuristics, retrain predictive models; validate with golden datasets.
- **UX Evolution Planning**: Review field workflows, dashboard insights, onboarding flows; plan next-gen UX improvements.
- **Infrastructure Scaling Plan**: Project sync/storage/telemetry needs; plan scaling, redundancy, cost optimization.
- **Risk Assessment/Mitigation**: Identify new risks, review mitigations, update risk register, assign owners.

---

## 4. Cross‑Cycle Integration Surfaces

- **Cycle Reinforcement**: Weekly cycles feed monthly audits; monthly audits inform quarterly evolution; quarterly direction sets weekly priorities.
- **Telemetry → Decisions**: Telemetry/metrics drive weekly, monthly, quarterly decisions; feedback loops ensure data-driven ops.
- **Sync Health → Roadmap**: Sync issues prioritized in roadmap; health metrics reviewed weekly/monthly.
- **User Behavior → Models**: User actions/feedback shape predictive models; model drift triggers recalibration.
- **Architecture Drift → Correction**: Detected drift (weekly/monthly) triggers architecture review, correction logged, actioned.

---

## 5. Founder Tools & Templates

- **Weekly Review Template**: Priorities, key metrics, blockers, wins, drift flags, corrective actions, commitments.
- **Monthly Audit Template**: Subsystem health, architecture checks, intelligence review, doc deltas, release readiness.
- **Quarterly Evolution Template**: Direction review, model recalibration, UX planning, infra scaling, risk assessment.
- **Decision Log Structure**: Date, context, decision, rationale, owner, follow-up.
- **Architecture Delta Log**: Date, subsystem, change, drift detected, correction, status.

---

## 6. Reliability & Leadership Guarantees

- **Deterministic Operating Behavior**: All cycles, reviews, and actions follow defined templates and rules; no ad hoc drift.
- **No-Drift Leadership Rules**: All deviations from plan logged, reviewed, and corrected; vision continuity enforced.
- **Transparency/Auditability**: All decisions, corrections, and deltas logged; accessible for review and audit.
- **Continuity of Vision**: Quarterly direction cascades to monthly/weekly cycles; all actions traceable to vision.

---

## 7. Architecture Diagrams (Text-Described)

- **Operating Cycle Loop**: Weekly → monthly → quarterly → weekly; each cycle feeds the next, closes the loop.
- **Decision Flow Graph**: Inputs (telemetry, feedback, metrics) → decision nodes (prioritize, escalate, defer) → commitments/actions → review/log.
- **Telemetry → Insight → Action Pipeline**: Telemetry/metrics → analysis → insight generation → action/decision → feedback loop.
- **Drift Detection/Correction Map**: Metrics/targets comparison → drift flag → correction assignment → action → log/review.

**This FOCB ensures deterministic, transparent, and vision-aligned operating rhythms for Rockhound, supporting robust, adaptive, and no-drift platform leadership.**
