# Lapidary Unified Multi‑Year Operating Epoch Plan (L‑UMYOEP)

## Purpose

Deterministically unify all stabilization, governance, evolution, ecosystem, category-leadership, and founder-presence cycles into a single, integrated 5-year operating epoch, with explicit multi-year arcs, epoch-level structures, and continuous oversight.

## 1. Multi‑Year Strategic Arcs (5-Year Horizon)

- **Epoch Vision:** Define and publish a 5-year vision for Lapidary and Rockhound, integrating stabilization, governance, evolution, ecosystem, category, and founder-presence goals.
- **Strategic Arc Mapping:** Predefine 5-year arcs for governance, evolution, ecosystem federation, category expansion, and founder scaling.
- **Epoch Milestones:** Set annual and quarterly milestones for all domains; update arcs based on synthesis outcomes.

## 2. Epoch‑Level Governance Structures

- **Epoch Governance Board:** Establish a multi-year governance board with escalation, audit, and synthesis authority.
- **Canonical Blueprinting:** All blueprints, templates, and cycles are versioned and governed at the epoch level.
- **Escalation Protocols:** Multi-layer escalation paths from weekly to epoch board; all critical events logged and resolved at the appropriate layer.

## 3. Evolution Engines

- **Long-Horizon Evolution Engine:** Define and operate a 5-year evolution engine with pre-set triggers for blueprint, system, and self-improvement upgrades.
- **Quarterly Evolution Sprints:** Run quarterly sprints for blueprint, schema, and process evolution; escalate major shifts to epoch board.
- **Annual Evolution Synthesis:** Annual review and recalibration of evolution priorities and engine parameters.

## 4. Ecosystem Federation Phases

- **Federation Roadmap:** Map out 5-year phases for ecosystem federation, partnership expansion, and cross-system integration.
- **Ecosystem Maturity Milestones:** Define and track maturity milestones for each federation phase.
- **Federation Synthesis:** Annual and quarterly syntheses to recalibrate federation strategy and integration.

## 5. Category‑Leadership Expansion

- **Category Arc:** Define 5-year arc for category creation, language propagation, and stewardship scaling.
- **Expansion Milestones:** Set and track annual/quarterly expansion targets; adapt based on ecosystem and federation signals.
- **Category Synthesis:** Quarterly and annual syntheses to recalibrate category vision and leadership posture.

## 6. Founder‑Presence Scaling

- **Founder Epoch Cadence:** Define and execute a 5-year founder presence scaling plan, including public narrative, ritual cadence, and presence delegation.
- **Presence Milestones:** Set annual and quarterly presence scaling targets; adapt based on system and ecosystem growth.
- **Founder Synthesis:** Annual and quarterly founder syntheses to recalibrate presence, cadence, and narrative.

## 7. Canon Growth Rules

- **Canon Expansion Protocols:** Govern all blueprint, template, and glossary growth at the epoch level; require board signoff for major expansions.
- **Cross-Linking Enforcement:** All new canon elements must be cross-linked and versioned; drift triggers auto-escalation.
- **Annual Canon Synthesis:** Annual review and publication of canon growth, cross-linking, and integrity.

## 8. Drift‑Prevention Hardening

- **Epoch Drift Engine:** Operate a multi-layer drift-prevention engine with CI, audit, and escalation at all synthesis layers.
- **Drift Event Protocols:** All drift events are logged, escalated, and resolved at the appropriate synthesis layer.
- **Hardening Sprints:** Run quarterly hardening sprints to improve drift detection, correction, and prevention.

## 9. Telemetry‑Driven Oversight

- **Unified Telemetry Layer:** Ingest, store, and analyze all system, governance, evolution, and ecosystem telemetry at the epoch level.
- **Oversight Dashboard:** Real-time dashboard for board and founder to review all signals, escalations, and trends.
- **Synthesis-Driven Actions:** All synthesis layers (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual, epoch) trigger oversight actions based on telemetry.

## 10. Synthesis Layers (Integrated Epoch Framework)

- **Weekly:** Audit log review, drift/escalation signoff, integrity score update, founder review.
- **Monthly:** Canon re-index, template audit, governance/evolution sync, integrity checkpoint, founder synthesis.
- **Quarterly:** Full drift-prevention audit, evolution sprint, federation/category synthesis, canon publication, founder/board synthesis.
- **Annual:** Epoch milestone review, evolution/canon/federation/category synthesis, governance recalibration, founder/board synthesis.
- **Epoch:** 5-year synthesis, recalibration of all arcs, publication of epoch outcomes, and reset of next epoch vision.

**This L‑UMYOEP blueprint ensures deterministic, unified, and oversight-driven operation of Lapidary and Rockhound across a 5-year epoch, integrating all cycles, syntheses, and strategic arcs into a single operating framework.**
