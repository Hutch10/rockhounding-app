# Phase 230 — Rockhound Unified Recursion-Ladder Integration Layer (RUXL-UNIFY-RECURSION)

## Deterministic, Regeneration-Safe Unified Recursion-Ladder Integration Specification

---

### 1. Architecture

- **Unified Model:** Canon-governed, versioned model integrates era, epoch, and hyper-epoch recursion ladders; all dependencies and propagation paths explicitly defined.
- **Cross-Ladder Continuity/Propagation:** Deterministic continuity and propagation rules ensure seamless state transfer and integrity across all recursion ladders; no orphaned or partial transitions.
- **Global Invariants/Meta-Stability Constraints:** All global invariants and meta-stability constraints enforced at every recursion scale; changes are versioned, auditable, and rollback-capable.
- **Dependency Graph/Multi-Ladder Propagation:** Explicit, versioned dependency graph for all recursion ladders; deterministic multi-ladder propagation logic.

---

### 2. Engine / Execution Layer

- **Integrated Runtime:** All recursion ladders are integrated into a unified, continuous runtime; cycles are canon-governed and recursion-aware.
- **Sequencing/Triggers:** All cross-ladder cycles follow deterministic, rollback- and fallback-capable sequences; triggers are canon-governed and auditable.
- **ENG↔CANON↔INTEL Sync:** Synchronization across all engines and recursion scales; all state changes validated and versioned.
- **Safe Propagation:** Intelligence, canon, and engineering updates propagate safely and deterministically across all ladders; rollback on failure.

---

### 3. Stability & Safety

- **Drift Detection/Correction:** Automated, deterministic drift detection and correction at every recursion ladder boundary and within ladders.
- **Invariant Enforcement:** UX, UI, data, and intelligence invariants enforced at global scale; no drift or unvalidated transitions.
- **Degraded-Mode:** Deterministic degraded-mode behavior for all cross-ladder transitions; all actions rollback-capable.
- **Regeneration/Rollback:** All regeneration and rollback logic is deterministic, versioned, and auditable for unified recursion operation.

---

### 4. Performance & Reliability

- **Latency/Throughput:** ≤5s multi-ladder cycle latency; ≥99.999% successful cycles; resource usage bounded by device class and recursion context.
- **Multi-Device/Offline-First/Field-Mode:** All logic operates offline-first and field-mode aware; syncs and validations occur when connectivity resumes.
- **Long-Horizon Optimization:** Scheduled, deterministic optimization cycles across recursion lifecycles; performance baselines enforced.

---

### 5. Observability & Oversight

- **Telemetry Schema:** Real-time, versioned telemetry for all unified recursion operations; all events and anomalies logged.
- **Dashboards/Alerts:** Founder-grade dashboards; canon-governed alerts and anomaly detection at global recursion scale.
- **Oversight Rhythm:** Founder oversight integrated into all recursion-aware cycles; all actions auditable and reviewable.

---

### 6. Output Requirements

- Ultra-dense, deterministic, single-pass, regeneration-safe
- Canonical JSON + human-readable spec
- No filler, no drift
