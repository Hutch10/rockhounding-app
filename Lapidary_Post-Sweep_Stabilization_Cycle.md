# Lapidary Post‑Sweep Stabilization Cycle (L‑PSSC)

## 1. Purpose

Deterministically activate all L‑PSILP lock‑in rules, enforce drift‑prevention, sequence structural improvements, synchronize governance/evolution, and establish the post‑sweep operating baseline for Lapidary and Rockhound.

## 2. Stabilization Loops

### Weekly Loop

- **Drift Detection:** Run CI drift/error checks (terminology, schema, template, cross‑reference).
- **Audit Log Review:** Centralize and review all audit, decision, and delta logs for new drift/escalations.
- **Blueprint/Activation Sync:** Validate all activation plans against blueprints; escalate mismatches.
- **Glossary Enforcement:** Check for unlinked terms in all new docs/code.
- **Telemetry Signals:** Collect and review system health, drift, and escalation telemetry.
- **Founder Oversight:** Founder reviews audit log summary and signs off on drift/escalation resolutions.

### Monthly Loop

- **Canon Re‑Index:** Re‑index all blueprints, activation plans, and templates; update cross‑references and glossary.
- **Template Enforcement:** Audit all logs and cycles for canonical template usage.
- **Governance/Evolution Sync:** Reconcile governance and evolution blueprints for cycle, escalation, and audit alignment.
- **Integrity Checkpoint:** Recalculate and publish system integrity score; escalate any drop below threshold.
- **Public Narrative Update:** Update public docs/narrative to reflect current lock‑in and stabilization state.
- **Founder Oversight:** Founder conducts deep-dive review of governance/evolution alignment and integrity score.

### Quarterly Loop

- **Structural Improvement Review:** Sequence and implement structural improvements from backlog.
- **Drift‑Prevention Audit:** Full audit of drift‑prevention mechanisms and CI enforcement.
- **Governance/Evolution Hardening:** Update and harden governance/evolution blueprints as needed.
- **Canon Index Publication:** Publish updated canon index and glossary.
- **Founder Oversight:** Founder leads synthesis session, recalibrates operating baseline, and sets next‑quarter lock‑in targets.

## 3. Telemetry Signals

- **Drift Events:** Automated detection and logging of terminology, schema, or template drift.
- **Escalation Events:** All escalations tracked and timestamped in audit log.
- **Integrity Score:** Weekly/monthly recalculation and trend analysis.
- **Template Usage:** Audit of canonical template adoption across all logs/cycles.
- **Governance/Evolution Sync:** Signals for blueprint/activation mismatches and cycle misalignments.

## 4. Integrity Checkpoints

- **Weekly:** Audit log review, drift/escalation signoff, integrity score update.
- **Monthly:** Canon re‑index, template audit, governance/evolution sync, integrity score publication.
- **Quarterly:** Full drift‑prevention audit, structural improvement review, canon index publication, baseline recalibration.

## 5. Founder‑Level Oversight Actions

- **Weekly:** Sign off on audit log and drift/escalation resolutions.
- **Monthly:** Deep-dive review of governance/evolution alignment and integrity score.
- **Quarterly:** Lead synthesis session, recalibrate baseline, set lock‑in targets, and publish canon index.
