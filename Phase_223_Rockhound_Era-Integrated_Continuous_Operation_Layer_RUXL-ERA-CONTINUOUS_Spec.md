# Phase 223 — Rockhound Era-Integrated Continuous Operation Layer (RUXL-ERA-CONTINUOUS)

## Deterministic, Regeneration-Safe Era-Integrated Continuous Operation Specification

---

### 1. Era-Integrated Continuous Operation Architecture

- **Unified Model:** Continuous-operation model unifies orchestration, stability, and maintenance across all eras; no operational gaps.
- **Era-Aware Orchestration:** Orchestration cycles are era-aware, canon-governed, and versioned; all actions validated against era invariants.
- **Era Invariants:** Canon-governed invariants enforced at every cycle; no drift or unvalidated transitions.
- **Multi-Device/Engine Continuity:** All devices and engines maintain deterministic continuity across era boundaries.
- **Regeneration Across Eras:** Regeneration logic is era-aware, rollback-capable, and deterministic; no orphaned or partial states.

---

### 2. Continuous Era Synchronization

- **ENG↔CANON↔INTEL Sync:** All engines synchronize state and dependencies deterministically across eras.
- **Dependency Graph Traversal:** Era-aware dependency graph traversed at every cycle; all dependencies validated.
- **Intelligence Consistency:** Cross-era intelligence consistency checks; no unvalidated propagation.
- **Engineering Continuity:** Engineering implementation continuity validated across all transitions.
- **Offline/Field Behavior:** Era transitions and syncs are offline-first and field-mode aware; syncs when connectivity resumes.

---

### 3. Autonomous Era Maintenance

- **Drift Detection/Correction:** Era-specific drift detected and corrected autonomously; all corrections canon-aligned.
- **Invariant Enforcement:** Era invariants enforced at every maintenance cycle; no drift tolerated.
- **Regeneration Logic:** Era-aware regeneration logic; all actions rollback- and replay-safe.
- **Fallback/Rollback:** Multi-era fallback and rollback rules; no data loss or orphaned states.
- **Maintenance Logs:** All maintenance actions are replay-safe, immutable, and auditable.

---

### 4. Era-Integrated Stability & Safety

- **Stability Guarantees:** Stability and safety rules persist across all era transitions; deterministic enforcement.
- **Safe Propagation:** Intelligence and canon updates propagate safely across eras; rollback on failure.
- **Sync/Update Safety:** Multi-era sync and intelligence updates bounded by safety rails and explainability.
- **Degraded-Mode:** Degraded-mode behavior is deterministic and rollback-capable across eras.
- **Reliability Constraints:** Long-horizon reliability constraints enforced at every cycle.

---

### 5. Founder Oversight & Observability

- **Dashboards:** Era-aware, real-time dashboards; cross-era, cross-engine visibility.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Automated, multi-era anomaly detection and canon-governed alerting.
- **Audit Trails:** Immutable, era-transition audit trails; deterministic event tracing.
- **Oversight Rhythm:** Founder oversight rhythm integrated into all era transitions and maintenance cycles.

---

### 6. Long-Horizon Evolution Integration

- **Evolution Cycles:** Seasonal, geological, and environmental evolution cycles integrated into continuous operation.
- **Intelligence Upgrade Continuity:** Intelligence-generation upgrades are continuity-validated and rollback-capable.
- **Device-Class Evolution:** Device-class evolution handled deterministically across eras; compatibility checks enforced.
- **Performance Baselines:** Multi-era performance baselines enforced and regression-tested at every cycle.
- **Continuity Across Recursion Ladders:** All logic supports deterministic continuity across recursion and meta-institutional ladders.

### 7. Output Requirements

- Ultra-dense, deterministic, single-pass, regeneration-safe
- Canonical JSON + human-readable spec
- No filler, no drift
