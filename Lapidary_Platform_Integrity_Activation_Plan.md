## 1. Governance Activation

- **Policy Enforcement**: Convert governance rules into explicit, enforceable policies; document rationale and scope.
- **Governance Loops**: Establish policy → enforcement (automated/manual) → audit (event logs, reviews) → refinement (policy updates, corrective action).
- **Escalation/Override Rules**: Define clear escalation paths for policy exceptions; user and founder override protocols; all overrides logged.
- **Transparency Boundaries/Communication**: Set boundaries for what is public vs. private; define communication surfaces (logs, changelogs, user notifications).

---

## 2. Integrity Activation (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Data Integrity**: Automated schema validation, contract versioning, compatibility checks, and data audits.
- **Intelligence Integrity**: Model drift detection, scoring audits, versioned model registry, golden dataset validation.
- **Autonomy Integrity**: Safe-action boundaries, deterministic fallbacks, user override, audit logs for all autonomous actions.
- **Sync Integrity**: Conflict resolution protocols, reconciliation guarantees, event log replay for all sync actions.
- **Telemetry Integrity**: Signal validation, anomaly detection, privacy filters, audit trails for all telemetry events.

---

## 3. Drift Prevention & Correction

- **Drift Triggers**: Architecture, intelligence, and ecosystem drift detected via automated and manual checks; triggers correction protocols.
- **Replay-Safe Correction Pipelines**: All corrections logged, versioned, and replayable; rollback and auditability guaranteed.
- **Founder Oversight**: Regular checkpoints for founder review of drift incidents and correction actions.

---

## 4. Audit System Activation

- **Quarterly Governance Audit**: Scheduled review of policy compliance, enforcement, and audit logs.
- **Annual Integrity Audit**: Deep-dive audits of data, intelligence, autonomy, sync, and telemetry integrity.
- **Audit Templates/Checklists**: Standardized templates for all audits; checklists for each subsystem and enforcement surface.
- **Audit Logging/Replay**: All audit actions/event logs are auditable, replayable, and versioned; audit trails accessible to authorized users.
- **Cross-Product Audit Alignment**: Governance and integrity audits aligned across Rockhound, future apps, and platform services.

---

## 5. Cross‑Subsystem Enforcement Surfaces

- **FieldSession**: Policy enforcement on session creation, data capture, telemetry feedback.
- **CaptureSession**: Preprocessing/classification rules enforced; integrity checks on all automated actions.
- **FindLog**: Enrichment/scoring rules; audit trails for all enrichments and scoring events.
- **Collection**: Categorization rules; consistency checks; long-term data integrity audits.
- **Dashboard**: Insight validation; anomaly detection; user-facing audit logs for all surfaced insights.

---

## 6. Reliability & Safety Guarantees

- **Deterministic Governance**: All governance and integrity actions deterministic, auditable, and replayable.
- **No-Drift Integrity Rules**: All deviations from policy or architecture logged, reviewed, and corrected.
- **Auditability/Transparency**: All decisions, corrections, and deltas logged; accessible for review and audit.
- **Continuity of Governance**: Quarterly/annual cycles ensure governance and integrity continuity across all products.

---

## 7. Implementation Blueprint

- **Governance Backlog Structure**: Prioritized, versioned, cross-product; includes policy, audit, and integrity items.
- **Integrity Checklist Library**: Standardized checklists for all enforcement surfaces and subsystems.
- **Drift Detection Dashboard Outline**: Real-time and historical drift incidents, correction status, audit log links.
- **Governance Calendar**: Quarterly and annual audit/review schedule; owner assignments.
- **Risk Matrix/Mitigation**: Governance and integrity risks identified, mitigations planned, owners assigned, status tracked.

**This L‑PIAP ensures Lapidary’s governance and integrity system is operationalized as a living, deterministic, and transparent foundation for platform trust and evolution.**
