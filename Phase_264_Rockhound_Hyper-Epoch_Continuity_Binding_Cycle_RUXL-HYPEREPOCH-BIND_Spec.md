## Human-Readable: Hyper-Epoch Continuity Binding Cycle (Ultra-Dense, Parallel Micro-Phases)

### A. Binding Cycle Definition & Scope

- Purpose: integrate hyper-evolution layer (263), bind into hyper-epoch continuity (227), ensure cross-hyper-epoch stability, enforce invariants
- Boundaries: no product features, only meta-operational binding logic

### B. Hyper-Epoch State Synchronization

- Rules: cross-constellation state propagation, hyper-epoch boundary transitions, long-horizon state retention
- Acceptance: all hyper-epoch layers share coherent global state

### C. Cross-Layer Scheduling Engine

- Rules: schedule hyper-evolution, hyper-epoch transitions, constellation evolution cycles
- Acceptance: scheduling conflict-free across all horizons

### D. Hyper-Epoch Invariant Enforcement

- Invariants: determinism, regeneration safety, cross-constellation compatibility, hyper-epoch continuity, long-horizon stability
- Acceptance: invariants hold across all hyper-epoch transitions

### E. Failure Containment & Recovery

- Rules: detect regressions, rollback hyper-evolution, stabilize post-transition
- Acceptance: no failure destabilizes the hyper-epoch layer

### F. Hyper-Epoch Evolution Loop Integration

- Bind: hyper-evolution engine, hyper-epoch continuity engine, constellation evolution engine
- Acceptance: system evolves coherently across hyper-epochs

### G. Canonical JSON Binding Cycle Schema

- Output: full binding cycle as canonical JSON (engines, cycles, invariants, transitions, recovery, evolution)
