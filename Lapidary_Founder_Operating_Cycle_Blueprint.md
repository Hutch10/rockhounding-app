## 1. Lapidary Weekly Operating Cycle

- **Core Leadership Loops**: Architecture review → validation (tests, user feedback) → integration (merge, deploy, document) → refinement (fix, optimize, automate).
- **Cross-Product Prioritization**: Weekly review of priorities across Rockhound, future apps, and platform services; allocate resources, resolve conflicts, update roadmap.
- **Intelligence Model Review**: Score model performance, review heuristics, detect drift, schedule retraining or tuning.
- **Sync/Offline Engine Health Checks**: Monitor latency, error rates, queue depth, and recovery; address regressions immediately.
- **Founder Communication Cadence**: Internal notes (weekly summary, blockers, wins), roadmap deltas (public/private, highlight shifts).

---

## 2. Monthly Strategic Cycle (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Platform Integrity Audits**: Validate determinism, replay safety, auditability; run chaos/edge tests; review event logs.
- **Ecosystem Intelligence Review**: Analyze behavioral trends, predictive accuracy, model drift; update intelligence models as needed.
- **Documentation Consolidation/Delta Updates**: Audit and merge doc changes, update onboarding and architecture docs, publish deltas.
- **Infrastructure Scaling Checkpoints**: Review storage, telemetry, sync queues; plan scaling, redundancy, cost optimization.
- **Category Evolution Review**: Assess ecosystem gravity, narrative alignment, category leadership; adjust vision and roadmap.

---

## 3. Quarterly Evolution Cycle

- **Long-Horizon Platform Direction**: Review/adjust 1-year, 3-year, 10-year vision; align product and platform strategy.
- **Intelligence Model Recalibration**: Re-weight features, tune heuristics, integrate new ML models; validate with golden datasets.
- **Product Portfolio Planning**: Sequence Rockhound, next product, and ecosystem services; allocate resources, set milestones.
- **Founder Presence/Narrative Evolution**: Review and evolve founder voice, public narrative, and leadership rituals.
- **Risk Assessment/Mitigation**: Identify new risks, review mitigations, update risk register, assign owners.

---

## 4. Cross‑Cycle Integration Surfaces

- **Cycle Reinforcement**: Weekly cycles feed monthly audits; monthly audits inform quarterly evolution; quarterly direction sets weekly priorities.
- **Telemetry → Decisions**: Telemetry/metrics drive weekly, monthly, quarterly decisions; feedback loops ensure data-driven ops.
- **User Behavior → Models**: User actions/feedback shape predictive models; model drift triggers recalibration.
- **Architecture Drift → Correction**: Detected drift (weekly/monthly) triggers architecture review, correction logged, actioned.
- **Rockhound Insights → Lapidary Evolution**: Rockhound product learnings inform Lapidary platform and future products.

---

## 5. Founder Tools & Templates

- **Weekly Review Template**: Priorities, key metrics, blockers, wins, drift flags, corrective actions, commitments.
- **Monthly Audit Template**: Platform health, architecture checks, intelligence review, doc deltas, scaling checkpoints.
- **Quarterly Evolution Template**: Direction review, model recalibration, portfolio planning, narrative evolution, risk assessment.
- **Decision Log Structure**: Date, context, decision, rationale, owner, follow-up.
- **Architecture Delta Log**: Date, subsystem, change, drift detected, correction, status.
- **Ecosystem Intelligence Dashboard Outline**: Usage, model accuracy, sync health, drift, category metrics.

---

## 6. Reliability & Leadership Guarantees

- **Deterministic Operating Behavior**: All cycles, reviews, and actions follow defined templates and rules; no ad hoc drift.
- **No-Drift Leadership Rules**: All deviations from plan logged, reviewed, and corrected; vision continuity enforced.
- **Transparency/Auditability**: All decisions, corrections, and deltas logged; accessible for review and audit.
- **Continuity of Vision**: Quarterly direction cascades to monthly/weekly cycles; all actions traceable to vision and platform strategy.

## 7. Architecture Diagrams (Text-Described)

- **Lapidary Operating Cycle Loop**: Weekly → monthly → quarterly → weekly; each cycle feeds the next, closes the loop.
- **Cross-Product Decision Flow Graph**: Inputs (telemetry, feedback, metrics) → decision nodes (prioritize, escalate, defer) → commitments/actions → review/log.
- **Telemetry → Insight → Action Pipeline**: Telemetry/metrics → analysis → insight generation → action/decision → feedback loop.
- **Ecosystem Intelligence Evolution Map**: Product insights → intelligence model updates → platform evolution → new product/service launches → feedback loop.

**This L‑FOCB ensures deterministic, transparent, and vision-aligned operating rhythms for Lapidary, supporting robust, adaptive, and no-drift platform leadership across Rockhound and future products.**
