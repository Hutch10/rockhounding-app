## 1. Evolution Loop Activation

- **Executable Pipelines**: Convert evolution loops into automated, replay-safe pipelines: signal (telemetry, drift, user correction) → evaluation (metrics, audit) → refinement (design, retrain, refactor) → deployment (controlled, versioned).
- **Evolution Triggers**: Telemetry anomalies, drift detection, user corrections, performance thresholds, scheduled reviews.
- **Replay-Safe Workflows**: All evolution steps logged, versioned, and replayable; rollback and auditability enforced.
- **Prioritization Rules**: Impact, urgency, user value, and ecosystem alignment drive evolution task priority; backlog reviewed weekly.

---

## 2. Intelligence Evolution Activation (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Model Recalibration Cadence**: Scheduled scoring, heuristic tuning, feature reweighting; golden dataset validation; versioned model registry.
- **Predictive Accuracy Review Loop**: Continuous review of predictive accuracy; anomalies flagged; retraining scheduled as needed.
- **User Correction Ingestion Pipeline**: All user corrections ingested, logged, and measured for model impact; feedback loop closes with user notification.
- **Offline-First Evolution Rules**: All intelligence evolution steps support offline-first operation; queued for sync and replay.
- **Safety/Transparency Boundaries**: All changes logged, user-visible; no black-box evolution; user override and auditability enforced.

---

## 3. Architecture Evolution Activation

- **Determinism Audit Cadence**: Regular audits for deterministic behavior; event log replay tests; non-determinism flagged and corrected.
- **Data Contract Evolution Workflow**: Versioned schemas, compatibility layers, replay safety for all contract changes; automated migration tests.
- **Sync/Offline Engine Evolution Rules**: Evolution rules for sync/queue logic; backward compatibility; performance regression checks.
- **Performance/Scaling Evolution Pipeline**: Storage, queue, and telemetry scaling plans; stress/chaos testing; regression prevention.
- **Regression Prevention/Hardening**: Automated regression tests; chaos/failure injection; hardening backlog.

---

## 4. Ecosystem Evolution Activation

- **Category Evolution Cadence**: Narrative, positioning, and mental model reviewed and evolved quarterly; category leadership maintained.
- **Gravity Amplification Loop**: Mechanisms to increase ecosystem stickiness; network effect optimization; community engagement.
- **Community/Network Effect Evolution**: Community scaffolding, leaderboards, events; feedback loops for community-driven evolution.
- **Cross-Device Continuity Evolution**: Seamless experience across devices; continuity audits; sync/merge improvements.
- **Long-Horizon Direction**: 1, 3, 10-year vision reviews; roadmap updates; ecosystem health metrics.

---

## 5. Founder Evolution Activation

- **Founder Presence Evolution Loop**: Regular review and refinement of public presence, voice, and leadership rituals.
- **Leadership Rhythm Refinement**: Cadence of reviews, updates, and rituals adjusted for platform maturity and scale.
- **Communication Cadence Evolution**: Feedback-driven refinement of communication frequency, format, and channels.
- **Decision-Making Auditability**: All major decisions logged, rationale documented, audit trails maintained.
- **Narrative Stewardship**: Founder ensures narrative clarity, category leadership, and vision continuity over time.

---

## 6. Evolution Observability & Drift Detection

- **Drift Detection Dashboard**: Real-time and historical drift incidents, correction status, audit log links.
- **Evolution Metrics/KPIs**: Drift incidents, regression rates, model accuracy, ecosystem growth, user feedback impact.
- **Telemetry Signals**: Telemetry and user feedback drive evolution prioritization; high-impact issues surfaced automatically.
- **Cross-Product Evolution Alignment**: Evolution signals and refinements propagate across Rockhound, future apps, and platform services; shared evolution backlog.

---

## 7. Implementation Blueprint

- **Quarterly Evolution Cycle**: Scheduled reviews, audits, recalibrations, and roadmap updates.
- **Annual Platform Recalibration**: Deep-dive audits, model retraining, architecture refactoring, vision refresh.
- **Evolution Backlog Structure**: Prioritized, versioned, cross-product; includes architecture, intelligence, ecosystem, and founder items.
- **Risk Matrix/Mitigation**: Evolution risks identified, mitigations planned, owners assigned, status tracked.
- **Evolution Review Templates**: Standardized templates for all reviews, audits, and recalibrations.

**This L‑EEAP ensures Lapidary’s evolution engine is a living, deterministic, and adaptive system, supporting robust, transparent, and no-drift platform improvement.**
