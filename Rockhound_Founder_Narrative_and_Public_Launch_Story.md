## 1. Founder Narrative

- **Origin Story**: Fieldwork frustration—fragmented tools, lost notes, missed discoveries—sparked the insight: what if fieldwork was intelligent, autonomous, and unified? Breakthrough: deterministic, event-driven architecture enabling mastery and continuity.
- **Founder Motivation/Mission**: Empower every explorer to achieve clarity, mastery, and discovery in the field; democratize field intelligence; steward a new era of outdoor science.
- **Philosophical Pillars**: Determinism (trust, auditability), Autonomy (proactive guidance), Field Intelligence (insight at every step), Mastery (continuous improvement).
- **Journey**: Idea → architecture (unified event model) → ecosystem (network effects, knowledge graph) → launch (public platform, new category).

## 2. Category Story

- **Old World**: Disconnected apps, manual logs, guesswork, inconsistent results; fieldwork as a black box.
- **The Shift**: Intelligence (real-time insights), autonomy (guided capture, proactive nudges), continuity (cross-device, offline-first).
- **New Category**: Field intelligence ecosystem—platform, not just an app; living network of users, finds, and knowledge.
