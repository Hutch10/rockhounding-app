# Lapidary Founder Operating Cycle — Week 1 Execution Plan (L‑FOC‑W1)

---

## 1. Weekly Objectives

- **Platform Stability**: Ensure core services stable, no critical errors, all health checks green.
- **Governance/Integrity**: Enforce policy compliance, run integrity audits, log all exceptions.
- **Evolution Engine**: Calibrate evolution pipelines, validate drift detection, schedule first recalibrations.
- **Rockhound Ecosystem**: Activate category language, value loops, and community scaffolding.
- **Founder Presence**: Publish daily micro-updates, draft weekly letter, align narrative with category pillars.

---

## 2. Daily Execution Rhythm (Parallel Micro‑Phases)

- **Day 1**: Canon review (all blueprints), scan for architecture deltas, log and classify changes.
- **Day 2**: Enforce governance policies, run data/model integrity checks, log compliance and exceptions.
- **Day 3**: Calibrate evolution engine, run drift detection, log triggers, schedule model/architecture updates.
- **Day 4**: Execute Rockhound ecosystem activation tasks (category language, value loops, community launch).
- **Day 5**: Activate founder presence (micro-update, community Q&A), review and align narrative, reinforce category stewardship.
- **Day 6**: Review telemetry, extract insights, flag drift, log predictive accuracy checkpoints, trigger evolution tasks.
- **Day 7**: Synthesize week’s actions, evaluate outcomes, refine processes, plan next week, escalate issues to monthly cycle.

---

## 3. Decision Log Activation

- **Decisions to Log**: All platform, governance, evolution, ecosystem, and narrative decisions.
- **Structure**: Date, context, decision, rationale, owner, follow-up, audit trail.
- **Quality Evaluation**: Review for clarity, rationale, impact, and auditability.
- **Auditability**: All entries versioned, cross-referenced, and reviewable.

---

## 4. Architecture Delta Log Activation

- **Deltas to Capture**: All architecture, model, and process changes; classify as critical, major, minor, low.
- **Validation**: Review for drift, ensure all deltas are deterministic and replay-safe.
- **Integration**: Feed deltas into next-week planning and evolution backlog.

---

## 5. Telemetry & Intelligence Review

- **Signals**: Platform health, sync/queue status, model accuracy, user engagement, error rates.
- **Drift Indicators**: Anomalies, regressions, unexpected trends.
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Checkpoints for model performance, user feedback, and correction rates.
- **Evolution Triggers**: Log triggers for recalibration, refactoring, or process improvement.

---

## 6. Founder Presence Execution

- **Daily Micro-Updates**: Themes—build progress, insights, field learnings, community highlights, narrative anchors.
- **Weekly Letter**: Outline—progress, philosophy, roadmap deltas, category narrative, next steps.
- **Narrative Alignment**: Daily/weekly review for consistency with category pillars and mental model.
- **Category Stewardship**: Reinforce category language, respond to community, clarify vision.

---

## 7. End-of-Week Synthesis

- **Evaluate**: Platform stability, governance compliance, evolution progress, ecosystem activation, founder presence.
- **Refine**: Adjust processes, update templates, address gaps.
- **Carry Forward**: Outstanding actions, unresolved issues, new insights.
- **Escalate**: Major issues, drift, or risks to monthly strategic cycle for deeper review.
